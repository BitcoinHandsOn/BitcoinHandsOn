# Exercise 21: Send bitcoin from your exchange to Blue Wallet Carol

When you first moved bitcoin from your exchange to your own wallet on Sparrow, you sent about half the amount you purchased on the exchange. This time, you will move the other half, and leave zero bitcoin on the exchange.

In the below instructions, I’m using Strike, on my phone. These are just example instructions—if you’re not using Strike, the sending process will be different from your exchange.

1.     I open Blue Wallet on my phone, and open the Carol wallet

2.     I click the **Receive** button on the bottom. A QR code will pop up, along with the bitcoin address that the QR code points to (starting with bc1). Next, I click on the **bitcoin address**. This will automatically copy it to the clipboard.

3.     Back in the Strike app, I make sure I’m in the Bitcoin section, by clicking **Bitcoin** in the bottom left. I scroll down in the screen and click the **Send button**, then I click on **Bitcoin Wallet.** (The other option is Username, which is an internal Strike send.)

4.     Still in Strike, I click **Paste** at the bottom, to paste in the bitcoin address I copied from Blue Wallet. (There’s also the option to scan a QR code for the bitcoin address here, which I ignore because I’m using two phone apps).

5.     The next screen in Strike is for the amount. I click the **Max** button to transfer the entire amount. Next is the screen to “Select delivery time”, where you can choose Priority, Standard, or Flexible. To avoid high fees, I choose the **Flexible** option for the transfer, which is free in Strike, but of course takes longer. Then I click **Next**.

6.     The final screen is Confirm send. Click **Confirm**. The transaction will either go through very quickly, or be in a pending status for a while, depending on the priority you choose.

You may now get a notification about receiving bitcoin in Blue Wallet. This depends on how quickly your transaction happens, and whether you’ve set up Blue Wallet to receive notifications.
