# Exercise 1: Install Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet

In this step we’ll install Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet. Sparrow is the most widely used and respected desktop Bitcoin wallet. It’s free—and more importantly, it’s open source. Open source software means that the code is publicly available for review. You can see the actual Sparrow Wallet source code right here: [https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow). This allows people to verify there’s nothing harmful hidden in the software.

Sparrow Wallet is suitable for beginners, but has all the functionality expert users need as well. So, it’s a great tool to use on your Bitcoin learning path. The Sparrow version that I used is 2.2.2. However, it’s frequently updated, and your version might be different. If any changes significantly impact these exercises, I will update them.

To install Sparrow, go to [https://sparrowwallet.com/download/](https://sparrowwallet.com/download/). You’ll see options for downloading versions for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Download and install whichever version matches your operating system. The instructions for the install will be different for each operating system.

If you’re using Windows, there’s an Installer version and a Standalone version. Download the Installer version unless you have a specific reason to use the Standalone version. During the install, leave all the settings at the default.

The instructions in the exercises will be with the Windows version of Sparrow, but it should be very similar in the MacOS and Linux versions.

I get a warning “Windows protected your PC” when I try to install

If you’re running Windows, there are filters turned on to protect you against unsafe software. But this filter can also be triggered by software that’s less common, like Sparrow. As long as you’ve downloaded Sparrow from the above link, you’re fine. In the warning window, click “More info” and then “Run anyway” to continue with the installation.

In the Edge Browser, the Sparrow download has an orange warning triangle

When using the Windows Edge Browser, a message comes up saying that the file isn’t commonly downloaded, and make sure you trust it before opening it. Click on the 3 dots to the right of this message, click Show more, and then Keep Anyway.

Is it hard to see the full screen in Sparrow, or is the text too small?

Sparrow is written in Java, to make it easier to run on different operating systems. However, one disadvantage is that it can cause screen resolution problems.

For me, with my resolution, I just live with it because it’s not too bad. But you can also change the resolution by clicking on the Windows Start button, typing “Resolution”, and then choosing the option “Change the resolution of the display”.

Then under Scale and Layout, click the dropdown under “Change the size of text, apps, and other items”, I experimented with reducing my resolution. On your computer you may need to reduce or increase the resolution.

Here’s some information from the developers of Sparrow on the problem:

What server to connect to?

When you install Sparrow, you’ll get some options about choosing a server. This server is what Sparrow uses to point to the Bitcoin network. For now, we’ll stick to the default of using a public server, mempool.space.

Troubleshooting your connection in Sparrow

Occasionally, you may notice that you can’t click the “Broadcast Transaction” button to send a transaction, or that you’re not seeing the latest transaction in a wallet. If the slider at the very bottom right corner in Sparrow is gray, you have lost your connection. This can happen sometimes, especially after restarting or switching wifi networks.

To fix this, click on the slider to reconnect, or click **File > Preferences > Server**, to edit and test your connection.

Some warnings

There are websites and applications out there that pretend to be the real thing, but are not. For instance, the real site for Sparrow is [https://sparrowwallet.com](https://sparrowwallet.com).

Unfortunately, a scam website (sparrowwallet.net) sometimes comes up when you search for Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet. But the software on that website is designed to steal your bitcoin.

So, always be careful of any bitcoin related software that you install. Check multiple sources to make sure you’re downloading from the right website.

Extra Credit: verify the software

When using open source software—especially bitcoin software—the extra step of verifying the software is recommended. Verification is a step that confirms that the software is actually what it’s supposed to be. It validates that there’s no extra code snuck in, that could somehow compromise your bitcoin.

Verifying, and knowing for yourself, is one of the core principles of Bitcoin. It’s embodied in the saying popular with bitcoiners: “Don’t trust, verify”. And it’s also easier, with Bitcoin. All the core software is open source, and you can review it.

Don’t trust, verify

To verify the Sparrow code, go to this page: [https://sparrowwallet.com/download/.](https://sparrowwallet.com/download/.) Scroll down to the “Verifying the Release” section, and follow the steps there. This will ensure that the download wasn’t corrupted with malware.
