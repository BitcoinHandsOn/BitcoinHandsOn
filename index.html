<p>Bitcoin Hands-On!</p>
<p><em>28 “learn-by-doing” exercises to master the basics of

managing</em></p>
<p><em>your own Bitcoin, including wallets, transactions, and self

custody</em></p>
<p>Sylvia Vasilik</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>This book is intended for educational and informational purposes

only. The content is the author’s understanding of Bitcoin. It should

not be considered financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Always do

your own research, consult qualified professionals, and follow local

laws and regulations. Protect your private keys and other data—lost or

stolen keys mean lost funds.</p>
<p>By reading this book, you accept full responsibility for your actions

and acknowledge these risks.</p>
































<h1 class="Header-1-without-numbers" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>First of all, thank you for purchasing this book! Any feedback would

be appreciated. For any questions or issues, please send email to <a href="feedback@BitcoinHandsOn.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feedback@BitcoinHandsOn.com</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll start out by telling you what this book is not. It’s not about

the “why” of Bitcoin. I’m going to assume that since you’re reading this

book, you’re convinced that Bitcoin has a lot of promise, and you

believe that learning how to use Bitcoin directly, without

intermediaries, is important.</p>
<p>It’s also not about the history of money, why government currencies

(also known as “fiat currencies”) seem to inevitably fail, how inflation

is actually theft, or similar topics. There are writers much smarter

than I am who have gone over these topics, in depth. I list some of the

best books in the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section.</p>
<p>Instead, this book is all about actually using Bitcoin. It’s about

using software to create wallets that you control directly—in other

words, self custody. It’s about understanding, at a very practical

level, what a private key is and why it’s important. It’s about learning

to manage your wallets, and sending and receiving sats (short for

satoshis, 1 bitcoin equals 100 million sats) without needing to go

through gatekeepers like banks or investment firms. Learning how to use

Bitcoin may be the most important technical skill you ever develop.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="why-is-self-custody-important">Why is self

custody important?</h3>
<p>Holding your own bitcoin—self custody—is key to getting the benefit

of Bitcoin, over the long run.</p>
<p>If you already own bitcoin, is it in self custody? Well, if you don’t

have the private key—the private key that you could use to send and

receive the bitcoin directly—then it’s not in self custody.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some cases where people think they own bitcoin, but

they don’t actually control it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you’re holding bitcoin on an ETF (exchange traded fund), then

you don’t have bitcoin in self custody, it’s all managed by the fund.

It’s not possible to withdraw actual bitcoin from the exchange. Instead,

you need to sell the bitcoin and withdraw USD.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re holding bitcoin on an exchange, such as Coinbase or

Kraken, then you still don’t have bitcoin in self custody.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An exchange is an improvement over an ETF, because usually you can

withdraw the bitcoin into a self custody wallet.</p>
<p>But still, many exchanges have failed—through hacks or fraud—since

Bitcoin’s creation. Early bitcoiners learned through bitter experience

that they shouldn’t trust exchanges.</p>
<p>The history of Bitcoin exchanges is full of these scams and thefts,

ranging from one of the earliest and most famous (Mt. Gox in 2014) to

more recent scams (FTX and Celsius in 2022).</p>
<p>There’s one thing these disasters had in common. It’s that the

supposed “owners” of the bitcoin did <em>not</em> actually hold their

own keys. Instead, they left their bitcoin in the custody of others, in

what are called “custodial wallets”. People thought it was safer to have

their bitcoin in the custody of large firms, instead of managing it

themselves. They were wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not your keys, not your coins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you didn’t understand “<em>Not your keys, not your coins</em>”,

you wouldn’t have necessarily known that you were doing something

dangerous, by relying on other people to manage your bitcoin.</p>
<p>For instance, take one of the more recent exchange failures, FTX.

Mainstream media news coverage of FTX was glowing. It stayed positive

until just before the whole thing unraveled, and was revealed as a huge

scam. Most users didn’t realize they were taking a serious risk by

leaving their bitcoin on the platform.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="its-not-as-hard-as-it-seems">It’s not as

hard as it seems</h3>
<p>For many people, self custody—using bitcoin directly and holding the

private key themselves—is intimidating. Without an intermediary like a

bitcoin exchange or ETF, people worry about making mistakes and losing

their hard-earned money. Many people avoid self custody because they

don’t understand seed phrases and private keys.</p>
<p>Bitcoin can seem mystifying and complex. It may seem that using

Bitcoin requires an understanding of the underlying technology, and

in-depth knowledge of cryptography.</p>
<p>But that’s absolutely not true. I’m here to tell you that you do

<em>not</em> need this in-depth knowledge. Do you need to understand how

a car engine works, in order to drive? No, you don’t. You also don’t

need to understand every technical detail about how Bitcoin works, in

order to safely use it.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="taking-small-steps-in-a-safe-environment">Taking small steps in a

safe environment</h3>
<p>The learn-by-doing exercises in this book will walk you through the

process of learning Bitcoin, one simple step at a time.</p>
<p>When you’re learning to drive a car, do you immediately start driving

on the highway? No, you don’t. You head to a large parking lot, and

practice driving there. You make a lot of left turns and right turns,

starts and stops. That’s what you’ll be doing in Bitcoin, Hands-On—lots

of practice, in a low-risk environment.</p>
<p>Working your way through this book will help you overcome the anxiety

that can come with managing your own bitcoin. The exercises use a few

temporary, small test wallets, that you create and control. This is the

Bitcoin equivalent of taking your first drive in a parking lot, to learn

about the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brake.</p>
<p>With these small wallets, you’ll make steady progress through the

exercises with small amounts, gaining confidence and learning to avoid

the problems that can occur. You master the skills you need to safely

send, receive, and store bitcoin.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="how-to-get-the-most-out-of-this-book">How

to get the most out of this book</h3>
<p>Here’s a few tips on going through the exercises, and how to really

learn the practical aspects of Bitcoin—in a way that sticks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name the wallets exactly as shown in the instructions. This makes

it easier to follow along, because the same wallets are used throughout

the whole book.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete all the exercises, even if you think you know what’s

going to happen. Actually doing the steps is key to learning. Just

reading isn’t enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider doing each exercise twice. First, follow along step by

step with the book. Then, try it again without the instructions—just

from memory and the name of the exercise. That’s where the real learning

happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Transaction fees now (early 2025) are quite low. But if you’re

concerned about fees, the lowest fees are usually on weekend mornings,

US east coast time (EST). So, consider doing the exercises that involve

transactions during that time. You’ll learn more in exercises 17 and 18

about fees.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="authors-note-on-bitcoin-capitalization">Author’s note on Bitcoin

capitalization: </h3>
<p>Standards are still evolving on when Bitcoin should be capitalized,

but the consensus seems to be—upper case when speaking of Bitcoin as a

system, and lower case when speaking of the currency units, or as an

adjective. That’s what I do in this book.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-1-install-sparrow-bitcoin-wallet">Exercise 1: Install

Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet</h1>
<p>In this step we’ll install Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet. Sparrow is the

most widely used and respected desktop Bitcoin wallet. It’s free—and

more importantly, it’s open source. Open source software means that the

code is publicly available for review. You can see the actual Sparrow

Wallet source code right here: <a href="https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow</a>.

This allows people to verify there’s nothing harmful hidden in the

software.</p>
<p>Sparrow Wallet is suitable for beginners, but has all the

functionality expert users need as well. So, it’s a great tool to use on

your Bitcoin learning path. The Sparrow version that I used is 2.2.2.

However, it’s frequently updated, and your version might be different.

If any changes significantly impact these exercises, I will update

them.</p>
<p>To install Sparrow, go to <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sparrowwallet.com/download/</a>.

You’ll see options for downloading versions for MacOS, Windows, and

Linux. Download and install whichever version matches your operating

system. The instructions for the install will be different for each

operating system.</p>
<p>If you’re using Windows, there’s an Installer version and a

Standalone version. Download the Installer version unless you have a

specific reason to use the Standalone version. During the install, leave

all the settings at the default.</p>
<p>The instructions in the exercises will be with the Windows version of

Sparrow, but it should be very similar in the MacOS and Linux

versions.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="i-get-a-warning-windows-protected-your-pc-when-i-try-to-install">I

get a warning “Windows protected your PC” when I try to install</h3>
<p>If you’re running Windows, there are filters turned on to protect you

against unsafe software. But this filter can also be triggered by

software that’s less common, like Sparrow. As long as you’ve downloaded

Sparrow from the above link, you’re fine. In the warning window, click

“More info” and then “Run anyway” to continue with the installation.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="in-the-edge-browser-the-sparrow-download-has-an-orange-warning-triangle">In

the Edge Browser, the Sparrow download has an orange warning

triangle</h3>
<p>When using the Windows Edge Browser, a message comes up saying that

the file isn’t commonly downloaded, and make sure you trust it before

opening it. Click on the 3 dots to the right of this message, click Show

more, and then Keep Anyway.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="is-it-hard-to-see-the-full-screen-in-sparrow-or-is-the-text-too-small">Is

it hard to see the full screen in Sparrow, or is the text too

small?</h3>
<p>Sparrow is written in Java, to make it easier to run on different

operating systems. However, one disadvantage is that it can cause screen

resolution problems.</p>
<p>For me, with my resolution, I just live with it because it’s not too

bad. But you can also change the resolution by clicking on the Windows

Start button, typing “Resolution”, and then choosing the option “Change

the resolution of the display”.</p>
<p>Then under Scale and Layout, click the dropdown under “Change the

size of text, apps, and other items”, I experimented with reducing my

resolution. On your computer you may need to reduce or increase the

resolution.</p>
<p>Here’s some information from the developers of Sparrow on the

problem:</p>
<p><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#im-running-on-a-high-resolution-screen-and-sparrow-icons-and-text-are-tiny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#im-running-on-a-high-resolution-screen-and-sparrow-icons-and-text-are-tiny</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#sparrow-is-too-big-for-my-screen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#sparrow-is-too-big-for-my-screen</a></p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="what-server-to-connect-to">What server to

connect to?</h3>
<p>When you install Sparrow, you’ll get some options about choosing a

server. This server is what Sparrow uses to point to the Bitcoin

network. For now, we’ll stick to the default of using a public server,

mempool.space.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="troubleshooting-your-connection-in-sparrow">Troubleshooting your

connection in Sparrow</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you may notice that you can’t click the “Broadcast

Transaction” button to send a transaction, or that you’re not seeing the

latest transaction in a wallet. If the slider at the very bottom right

corner in Sparrow is gray, you have lost your connection. This can

happen sometimes, especially after restarting or switching wifi

networks.</p>
<p>To fix this, click on the slider to reconnect, or click <strong>File

&gt; Preferences &gt; Server</strong>, to edit and test your

connection.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="some-warnings">Some warnings </h3>
<p>There are websites and applications out there that pretend to be the

real thing, but are not. For instance, the real site for Sparrow is <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sparrowwallet.com</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a scam website (sparrowwallet.net) sometimes comes up

when you search for Sparrow Bitcoin Wallet. But the software on that

website is designed to steal your bitcoin.</p>
<p>So, always be careful of any bitcoin related software that you

install. Check multiple sources to make sure you’re downloading from the

right website.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="extra-credit-verify-the-software">Extra

Credit: verify the software</h3>
<p>When using open source software—especially bitcoin software—the extra

step of verifying the software is recommended. Verification is a step

that confirms that the software is actually what it’s supposed to be. It

validates that there’s no extra code snuck in, that could somehow

compromise your bitcoin.</p>
<p>Verifying, and knowing for yourself, is one of the core principles of

Bitcoin. It’s embodied in the saying popular with bitcoiners: “Don’t

trust, verify”. And it’s also easier, with Bitcoin. All the core

software is open source, and you can review it.</p>

<p>Don’t trust, verify</p>

<h1 id="exercise-2-create-alice-wallet-in-sparrow">Exercise 2: Create

Alice wallet in Sparrow</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll create your first wallet. Wallets are the

foundation of working with bitcoin, and most of the exercises in this

book involve wallets. The name Alice will be used for this wallet. You

can think of the wallet as belonging to Alice. Later on, you’ll create

more wallets, belonging to different characters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Sparrow, and click on <strong>File &gt; New Wallet</strong>.

For the wallet name, type “Alice”, and click <strong>Create

Wallet</strong>. (Ignore the “Has existing transactions” checkbox,

you’ll never use it.)</p></li>
<li><p>Next, in the Settings window, leave everything at the defaults

(policy type Single Signature, Script Type of Native Segwit). Below in

the Keystores area of the Settings window, choose <strong>New or

imported software wallet.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In the window that comes up, look for the button on the top right

that says Use 24 words and <strong>click the arrow to the

right</strong>. Choose <strong>Use 12 words instead</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A screen will pop up with 12 blank spaces for your words. At the

bottom, click <strong>Generate New</strong> to have Sparrow

auto-generate them. (Ignore the “Use passphrase?” checkbox.)</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Sparrow will now generate a list of random words for your seed

phrase.</p></li>
<li><p>They’re based on a special list of 2048 unique words, called the

BIP39 list. The words were chosen because they’re common, easy to spell,

and the first 4 letters are unique for each word.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Write down the words</strong> on a sheet of paper. Make

sure to number them correctly, because the order is very important.

Label the words “Alice Seed phrase”.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve written down the words, click on <strong>Confirm

Backup</strong>. On the next screen, confirm that you’ve written them

down. Then click on <strong>Re-enter Words</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now re-enter the 12 words, then click <strong>Create

Keystore,</strong> then <strong>Import Keystore</strong> in the top

right.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re back at the main screen, the Settings window. You need to

apply all the changes you’ve made. Click <strong>Apply</strong>, on the

bottom right. In the Wallet Password screen that comes up next, click

<strong>No Password</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve created your first wallet.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-seed-phrases-and-private-keys">Learn more: seed phrases

and private keys</h3>
<p>In this exercise, we asked Sparrow to generate the Mnemonic Words.

These words are also commonly called the recovery phrase, backup phrase,

or seed words. But the most common way to refer to these words is “seed

phrase”. That’s what I’ll use in this book.</p>
<p>This seed phrase represents a very large number, that’s more random

and impossible to guess than we can comprehend. The seed phrase is just

an easy way for humans to remember and write down that number, using a

specific set of common words. This list is called the BIP39 word

list.</p>
<p>For instance, here’s a sample 12 word seed phrase:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%"/>
<col style="width: 33%"/>
<col style="width: 33%"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. labor</td>
<td>5. check</td>
<td>9. gauge</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2. stable</td>
<td>6. amused</td>
<td>10. fat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. narrow</td>
<td>7. young</td>
<td>11. surface</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. high</td>
<td>8. rotate</td>
<td>12. cradle</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It translates into this very large hexadecimal number:</p>
<p>775638ce67a669ae9fcb7e5618782bdaafe93c233ebc09469144f475b2c74bf55f4752b51e1abb17460877c4cf9b2ae283f2e48831dc244f8d1ff5f184c1b33f</p>
<p>You can see why the seed phrase is easier to write down! This number

is usually called the private key. Sometimes, in more technical

discussions, it’s called the Master Private Key or Extended Private Key.

But in this book, I’ll use the term private key. We’ll talk more later

about how important it is to keep the seed phrase (and thus the private

key) private and secure.</p>
<p>There are also methods for generating your own random words for a

seed phrase with dice or coin tosses, without having Sparrow do it for

you. I won’t go into them in this book.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-wallets">Learn more:

wallets</h3>
<p>Is the word “wallet” the best word to use, for what you’re creating

here? It’s been used a long time, and it’s the best word we have. But it

can be misleading. It suggests that there is bitcoin actually stored in

the wallet, but that’s not true.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of the wallet as containing bitcoin, it’s better

to think of the wallet as containing a key. The key that it contains is

the private key, encoded from the seed phrase. The private key can

unlock certain, specific chunks of bitcoin on the blockchain—any bitcoin

that’s associated with addresses that belong to that private key. One

private key can contain many addresses.</p>
<p>As you work through the rest of the book, you will create these

separate wallets, each with its own unique seed phrase (private key).

These wallets will be named:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Alice</strong>: The wallet you just created in Sparrow

(Exercise 2)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bob</strong>: A second wallet that you’ll create in

Sparrow (in Exercise 6)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Carol</strong>: A wallet that you’ll set up in Blue

Wallet, a popular bitcoin wallet application (in Exercise 19)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dan</strong>: A wallet you create as a bonus final

exercise, in Blockstream, which is another multi-platform bitcoin wallet

(in Exercise 27)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although you will create a few other wallets, they will all be

derived from one of these four.</p>
<p>Though we’re naming wallets after people (like Alice and Bob), this

is just to make it easier to understand. But one person <em>can</em>

have multiple wallets, for different purposes. For instance, Alice may

have a Cold Storage wallet, and a Spending wallet, just like you might

have a savings account and a checking account at a bank.</p>
<p>Using these different wallets, in multiple bitcoin wallet

applications, you’ll gain hands on experience with many user interfaces.

This approach is an excellent way to master the fundamentals of Bitcoin,

and to learn the skills needed to safely hold, send, and receive

bitcoin.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-3-buy-bitcoin">Exercise 3: Buy Bitcoin</h1>
<p>In this step, you’ll actually purchase bitcoin, using whichever

source you prefer from the options given below. In the exercise after

this one, you’ll move some of that bitcoin to the wallet you created in

Exercise 2.</p>
<p>How much will you buy? Choose an amount that you’re comfortable with,

probably less than 50 to 100 USD, or the equivalent in other

currencies.</p>
<p>This should be an amount small enough that you’re not worried about

losing it, but large enough to be able to do all the exercises. You’ll

pay transaction fees to move the bitcoin around to different wallets,

but otherwise the bitcoin is yours to keep. And you’ll learn more about

transaction fees as you go through the exercises.</p>
<p>A reminder<strong>—</strong>when you’re buying bitcoin in this step,

you’re <em>not</em> buying it on an exchange traded fund (ETF), because

then you wouldn’t be holding and managing your own bitcoin. Instead,

you’re buying bitcoin that you can receive into your own wallet, in self

custody.</p>
<p>Since there’s so many different sources to buy bitcoin from, I can’t

walk you through the process of setting up an account and buying

bitcoin, because it will be different everywhere. But I’ll give you some

general thoughts about the best ways and sources to buy from.</p>
<p>Also, a note about keeping your bitcoin safe—at this point, you just

need to take very basic security precautions. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The amounts that you’re dealing with are small.</p></li>
<li><p>The wallets you’re working with are temporary. Once you’ve

finished the exercises, you’ll send the bitcoin to another

wallet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="where-should-you-buy-bitcoin-kyc-or-p2p">Where should you buy

bitcoin? KYC or P2P</h3>
<p>There are two main ways of buying bitcoin, KYC (“Know Your Customer”)

and P2P (Peer To Peer).</p>
<p><strong>KYC</strong> is what most people use, in countries where

exchanges are available. It means using a centralized exchange, which

follows government “Know Your Customer” laws. On a KYC exchange, you

need to open an account, linked to your government ID, to purchase

bitcoin. You will need to go through an identity verification process.

This usually includes submitting photos of government-issued ID, as well

as facial scans.</p>
<p><strong>P2P</strong> means you’re not going through a regular

exchange. Instead, you’re buying from a peer—someone who owns bitcoin

and wants to sell it.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to have a friend or family member who’s

willing to sell you a small amount of bitcoin, then the transaction can

be very simple. You hand the friend or family member some cash, and give

them a bitcoin address from your wallet. Then they send you the bitcoin

(minus the transaction fee).</p>
<p>But often, P2P trades will be done online, via one of the secure,

private services mentioned below.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of buying P2P is increased privacy. If

you’re buying peer to peer, the only other person that knows about the

purchase is the seller. However, if you’re buying from a KYC exchange,

your personal information is available to both the exchange, and the

government. And considering how often companies have been hacked and

their customer database stolen—it’s not just the government who could

get your data. Criminal gangs could get it as well.</p>
<p>The problem for people just starting to buy bitcoin is that for these

P2P services, you need to already own at least a small amount of

bitcoin. This is because usually a bitcoin bond or escrow needs to be

set up.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="kyc-exchanges">KYC Exchanges</h3>
<p>If you’ve decided that for now, you’ll use a KYC exchange, you have

many options.</p>
<p>It’s important to purchase from a bitcoin-only exchange. An exchange

that is bitcoin-only will have fewer points of failure. And more

importantly, they won’t try to sell you other, inferior

cryptocurrencies, that they make more commission on. Companies that sell

anything other than bitcoin (exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken,

Robinhood, Binance) are <em>not</em> recommended.</p>
<p>There’s a saying among bitcoiners that expresses a core belief—that

Bitcoin stands alone, and is fundamentally superior to other

cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin, not crypto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s some KYC exchanges that are Bitcoin-only. This is not an

exhaustive list, and this information can change quickly, so do your own

research. Also, the exchange should make it very clear that they will

actually allow you to withdraw your bitcoin, to your own wallet.</p>

<p>In general, using a P2P exchange can be a little more challenging.

<p>Robosats requires a Bitcoin Lightning wallet in order to use it (see

the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section at the end of this book

for more information on Lightning), but it’s one of the most popular and

easiest P2P exchanges.</p>
<p>In the next exercise, you will need to have already completed the

purchase of bitcoin. It needs to be ready to send, from the exchange to

your own receive address.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-4-receive-bitcoin-into-your-alice-wallet">Exercise 4:

Receive bitcoin into your Alice wallet</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll actually receive bitcoin into your wallet.

The procedure will be a little different on each exchange. Some

exchanges may even require you to get approval for the receive

address.</p>
<p>But basically, it will involve steps similar to this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open up the website or app for your exchange (where you bought

the bitcoin), and navigate to where you can send bitcoin out of the

exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a bitcoin address. (This will be a receive address that you

get from the Alice wallet).</p></li>
<li><p>Decide how much you want to send. It’s easier to think of bitcoin

amounts in terms of sats, because 1 bitcoin is now very expensive. (Sats

is short for Satoshis. One whole bitcoin equals 100 million

sats.)</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the amount of sats you want to send to the Alice receive

address.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide on the amount of fees you’re willing to pay. Some

exchanges may offer free transaction fees.</p></li>
<li><p>Hit the send button, and wait for the bitcoin to arrive in your

wallet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="example-using-strike-to-receive-bitcoin">Example: Using Strike to

receive bitcoin</h3>
<p>These are what the steps look like when sending bitcoin from Strike,

the KYC exchange that I mentioned above. Remember, the process in the

exchange that you use will be different. Using Strike (which is a mobile

app on your phone), it’s easiest to use QR codes to get the bitcoin

receive address, instead of copying and pasting the address.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, open up the Alice wallet file. Click on the blue

<strong>Receive</strong> button on the left. Your wallet has many, many

receive addresses, and Sparrow will show you the first available

address.</p></li>
<li><p>Label the receive address. I wrote “Receive from Strike” in the

label. When using the defaults in Sparrow, all bitcoin addresses start

with bc1. The QR code for the address, which I’ll use in the next step,

is to the right of the address.<br/>

Don’t skip the label! Some of the following exercises depend on having

labels.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Strike app, I click the Bitcoin icon at the bottom left. I

scroll to the Send screen, and click Bitcoin wallet.<br/>

Then I go back to Sparrow on my computer, where the Receive window is

still open. I use Strike on my phone to scan the Sparrow QR code for the

receive address.</p></li>
<li><p>In Strike, I enter the amount of sats that I want to send (about

half of what I purchased).</p></li>
<li><p>Next is the fee. I could either pay a larger fee, to have the

transaction go through in the next 10 minutes, a medium fee to send it

in the next hour, or zero, to have it go through in the next 24

hours.<br/>

I chose to pay the higher fee, and have it go through within about 10

minutes. Other exchanges will have different options for fees.</p></li>
<li><p>On the next screen I review the details (amount, receive

address), before clicking to confirm the transaction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the exchange you’re using is a desktop application, and not a

mobile app, you’ll need to copy and paste the bitcoin address, instead

of using a QR code.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="monitoring-the-receive-into-alice">Monitoring the receive into

Alice</h3>
<p>You will now receive the bitcoin into your Alice wallet, in Sparrow.

No matter where the bitcoin originally came from, here’s what you should

see as the transaction goes through.</p>
<p>If you’ve chosen to pay a higher fee for a quicker transaction, it’ll

all happen within about 10 minutes. Otherwise it will take longer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first step is that you get a pop-up notice in the top right

corner, in Sparrow. It’ll have a message entitled “New mempool

transaction”, and the amount of the transaction. These Sparrow

notifications disappear after a few seconds.<br/>

That means your transaction is in the mempool. (See the below section

“Learn more: Mempool and Blockchain” for more info.)</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve gotten the pop-up notice in your Alice wallet, click

on the blue <strong>Transactions</strong> button on the left. You should

have one transaction in there, from the transaction you just made. The

transaction will show up in light gray at first.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll receive another pop-up notification in Sparrow when the

first confirmation occurs, which is usually in about 10 minutes. Six

confirmations is usually considered final, and then the transaction in

Sparrow will switch from light gray to black.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that in the Transactions window, there’s a US dollar

amount in there. For the dollar amount, the current bitcoin price is

used. (To set up a different default currency, go to File &gt; Settings

&gt; Currency.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You now truly own some bitcoin, it’s on your own

personal wallet, and you have the private key.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="troubleshooting-your-connection-in-sparrow-1">Troubleshooting your

connection in Sparrow</h3>
<p>This was also mentioned in Exercise 1, but here’s a reminder, because

it happens often. You may notice that a transaction doesn't show up when

it should. If this happens, check the slider at the very bottom right

corner in Sparrow. If it's gray, you have lost your connection. This can

happen sometimes, especially after restarting.</p>
<p>To fix this, click on the slider to reconnect.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-mempool-and-blockchain">Learn

more: Mempool and blockchain</h3>
<p>The mempool is a holding area for bitcoin transactions that have been

submitted, but not yet added to a block. It’s like bitcoin’s waiting

room—an area where transactions sit before being included in a block.

When you send bitcoin, your transaction joins others in the mempool,

waiting for bitcoin miners to pick them up.</p>
<p>After a miner picks them up and confirms them in a new block, the

block gets added to the bitcoin blockchain. This means that the

transaction has one confirmation. When another block gets added to the

blockchain, your transaction will have two confirmations. Once it has

six confirmations, most people consider that “final settlement”—in other

words, it’s almost impossible to reverse.</p>
<p>What is the blockchain? It’s like a giant public notebook, or ledger,

of all the transactions that have ever occurred. By looking at the

blockchain, you can see exactly what the transactions were, the amounts

of the transactions, and the sending and receiving address.</p>
<p>You pay a fee, called the transaction fee, for having your

transaction included in the next block, and added to the blockchain.

This can be higher or lower, depending on how much competition there is

for transaction space in the bitcoin blockchain. Transactions that

include higher fees usually get chosen first by the miners, and go into

the very next block. Lower-fee transactions wait longer. We’ll discuss

fees in more detail later.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-bitcoin-mining">Learn more:

bitcoin mining </h3>
<p>Just now, in the section on Mempool and blockchain, the term bitcoin

miners came up. What is, actually, the process of bitcoin mining?</p>
<p>Basically, bitcoin mining happens with a decentralized network of

special computers (“miners”), all around the world. These miners are

competing to solve a mathematical problem, every 10 minutes. Whichever

computer finds the solution first gets to “mine” the next block of

transactions, which means linking the new block to the previous one in

the blockchain.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining takes special, expensive computers, and lots of

electricity. The reason that the miners do this work is that they earn

bitcoin in two different ways, each time they mine a block.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, there’s a reward in bitcoin, for the computer that mines

that block. This reward is substantial. In 2025, each mined block earns

3.125 bitcoin.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the successful miner gets to keep the transaction fees

associated with the block.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reward in bitcoin for the successful miner is straightforward,

it’s just a set amount.</p>
<p>The transaction fees are more complex. Every single transaction needs

to pay a fee, to pay for the work of putting it in the block. And

transaction fees depend on how busy the network is. If many people are

trying to make transactions, fees go up because there’s more competition

for a scarce resource—space on the bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>It’s similar to when a city is hosting the Olympics. Hotel rooms will

get much more expensive because there’s only a set amount of them.

Similarly, you will have to pay more in transaction fees when the

bitcoin network is congested.</p>
<p>Luckily, it’s now (in 2025) a period of relatively low fees, so the

transactions you’ll be making in these exercises will be relatively

inexpensive.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-5-recover-your-alice-wallet">Exercise 5: Recover your

Alice wallet</h1>
<p>Being able to recover your wallet is an important step in Bitcoin

security. If something unexpected happens, you need to be able to gain

access to your bitcoin again with just your seed phrase.</p>
<p>So, practicing recovery is a must, when learning to use bitcoin.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, click on <strong>File &gt; New Wallet</strong>. Name

the wallet “Alice Recovery” and click on <strong>Create

Wallet</strong>.<br/>

Note that we’re creating a new wallet file in Sparrow here, but it will

be derived from the original Alice wallet, and will have the same seed

phrase (private key).</p></li>
<li><p>You’re now in the Settings window. Leave the settings as they are

(Single Signature, Native Segwit). At the bottom in the Keystores

section, click <strong>New or Imported Software Wallet.</strong> In the

next window, look for the button on the top right that says Use 24 words

and <strong>click the arrow to the right.</strong> Choose <strong>Use 12

words</strong> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter in the 12 words you wrote down in the exercise “Create a

<li><p>Leave the derivation path at the default of m/84’/0’/0’, and

click on <strong>Import Keystore</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now at the bottom right corner of your screen, click the

<strong>Apply</strong> button. On the next screen, click <strong>No

<li><p>You have now recovered your Alice wallet. Click on to the blue

Transactions button on the left, to switch to that window. You should be

able to see the transaction you made earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Also check the addresses, between the original and the recovered

wallet. To do this, open the original Alice wallet, and click on the

blue Address button on the left. Do the same in the Alice Recovery

wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross check the first few Receive addresses between the two

wallets. Make sure they’re the same. If the addresses are the same, and

you see the previous transaction, you’ve restored the wallet correctly.

Congratulations!</p></li>

<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-wallet-recovery">Learn more:

wallet recovery</h3>
<p>It’s good to practice recovering a wallet occasionally. If you lose

your computer, or the Sparrow wallet file, or lose your hardware wallet,

you can still recover your wallet—but only if you kept the seed phrase

safe.</p>
<p>But if a disaster happened <em>and</em> you didn’t have your original

seed phrase or a backup, then unfortunately you’ve lost your funds. You

no longer have access to your bitcoin, and you can’t recover from

that.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="common-problems-when-recovering-wallets">Common problems when

recovering wallets</h3>
<p>Some of the common problems that occur when recovering wallets

are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Missing a Passphrase</p></li>
<li><p>Differences in Script Type</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll go over both of these issues in more depth in upcoming

exercises.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-6-create-wallet-bob">Exercise 6: Create wallet Bob

</h1>
<p>In this step, you'll create the Bob wallet—a completely new wallet,

with its own seed phrase. You’re doing this so that you can simulate

having another, separate bitcoin user. In future exercises, you'll

practice sending bitcoin from Alice to Bob.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Click on <strong>File &gt; New Wallet</strong>. For the wallet

name, type “Bob”, and click <strong>Create Wallet</strong>. In the

Settings window, leave everything at the defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>Below in the Keystores area of the Settings window, choose

<strong>New or imported software wallet.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In the next window, look for the button that says Use 24 words

and <strong>click the arrow to the right.</strong> Choose <strong>Use 12

words</strong> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>A screen will pop up with 12 blank spaces for your words. Click

<strong>Generate New</strong> to have Sparrow auto-generate them, and

ignore the “Use passphrase?” option. Now Sparrow has generated a list of

random words for your seed phrase.</p></li>
<li><p>Write down the words on a sheet of paper, numbering them

correctly. Label the words on the paper “Bob Seed phrase”.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve written down the words, click on <strong>Confirm

Backup</strong>. Confirm on the next screen that you’ve written them

down, and click <strong>Re-enter Words</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In this next screen, re-enter the 12 words. Then click on

<strong>Create Keystore</strong>, then <strong>Import Keystore</strong>

in the top right.</p></li>
<li><p>Now back at the Settings screen, you need to apply all the

changes you’ve made. Click <strong>Apply</strong>, on the bottom right.

In the Wallet Password screen that comes up next, click <strong>No

Password</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With these steps you’ve created a second bitcoin wallet on Sparrow,

one that we’ll use for sending and receiving along with your first

wallet, Alice.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-privacy-and-security">Learn

more: Privacy and security</h3>
<p>So far, you’ve created two wallets with separate seed phrases, the

Alice and Bob wallets. (The Alice Recovery wallet was based on the Alice

wallet seed phrase).</p>
<p>Seed phrases in bitcoin are very important to keep private and

secure. You also need to back the seed phrase up properly. There’s lots

of information to absorb on this topic, and bitcoiners often discuss it

at great length.</p>
<p>Later on in this book, we’ll go into this topic in more depth. For

now, though, don’t worry too much about privacy and security. The

wallets that you’re creating now are both small and temporary, so

security isn’t that much of a concern. You only need to be as careful as

you would be for the same amount of cash.</p>
<p>But when you have long-term wallets that will contain larger amounts

of bitcoin, you need to be more aware of security. There’s an upcoming

section later on, with more information on keeping your seed phrase

safe.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-7-your-first-sendtransfer-bitcoin-from-alice-to-bob">Exercise

7: Your first send—transfer bitcoin from Alice to Bob </h1>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll practice sending bitcoin from the Alice

wallet to the Bob wallet. In other words, you’re simulating Alice

sending some bitcoin to Bob.</p>
<p>The main thing that would be different if there were really two

separate people involved, is transferring the receive address. Instead

of being a simple copy/paste of a receive address between two wallets on

your computer, it would involve transferring the receive address between

2 different people. You could do this with an email, but more private

options like a QR code would be better.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Make sure the Alice and Bob wallets are open in Sparrow. You can

close the Alice Recovery wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Bob wallet, click on the blue <strong>Receive</strong>

button on the left. In the Label field, type in “receive from Alice”.

Then go to the Address field, and copy the address to the

clipboard.</p></li>
<li><p>In Alice, click on the blue <strong>Send</strong> button on the

left. In the “Pay to:” text box, paste the receive address from Bob.

Enter “send to Bob” in the Label field.<br/>

Remember, don’t skip the label! In following exercises you’ll need

them.</p></li>
<li><p>Still in the Alice wallet, in the Amount field, enter about half

of the sats that you have in Alice.<br/>

If you don’t remember how many sats are in Alice, an easy way to do that

is to click the Max button to the right of the amount. Then, divide that

in half. It’s best for privacy to not send a rounded amount—for

instance, instead of 25,000 sats, send 24,359. Sparrow recommends this

for privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>For now, we’ll leave the Fee set to the default.<br/>

(You’ll learn more later, but for now, just know that the fee is what

the miners receive, for running their specialized computers to process

bitcoin transactions. By default, Sparrow will suggest the fee amount

that gets the transaction processed into the next block. A lower fee

will often still get processed, but won’t necessarily get into the next

block.)</p></li>
<li><p>In the bottom right corner, click <strong>Create

Transaction</strong>. Sparrow will pop up a Transaction window, with

details of the transaction. We don’t need to go through all the details

right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Finalize Transaction for Signing</strong>, then

<strong>Sign</strong>. When you sign a transaction, you’re using your

private key to authorize it with a digital signature. Sparrow has access

to the private key because you’re using a software wallet, and the

private key (derived from the seed phrase) is stored with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Now click the <strong>Broadcast Transaction</strong> button. This

is the last step, and sends the fully signed transaction out to the

Bitcoin mempool.<br/>

(Is the Broadcast Transaction button missing? Check the troubleshooting

section below.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After you click the Broadcast Transaction button, you should quickly

see 2 notifications pop up on the top right corner of your screen. One

will show a debit for the Alice wallet, because we sent bitcoin out of

it. The other will show a credit for the Bob wallet, because it received

the bitcoin. This first pop-up is just to show that the transaction has

been received into the mempool. It doesn’t mean it’s been confirmed,

that’ll come in about 10 minutes.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="troubleshooting-broadcast-transaction-button-isnt-visible">Troubleshooting:

Broadcast Transaction button isn’t visible</h3>
<p>After you sign the transaction, the next thing you should see is a

Broadcast Transaction button. If you don’t see that, your connection may

have been lost.</p>
<p>Check the slider at the very bottom right corner in Sparrow. If it's

gray, you have lost your connection. This can happen sometimes,

especially after restarting.</p>
<p>To fix this, click on the slider to reconnect.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-addresses">Learn more:

addresses</h3>
<p>Bitcoin receive addresses are unique identifiers (strings of letters

and numbers) that bitcoin can be sent to, by anyone. One private key has

many different addresses. Addresses should never be reused, because that

makes your transactions much less private.</p>
<p>In Sparrow, in the Bob wallet, click on the blue Addresses button on

the left. Notice that you don’t have just one section for addresses.</p>
<p>Instead, you have two sections for addresses, the Receive and the

Change addresses, and they both have multiple addresses. And that’s not

all—there’s essentially an unlimited number of addresses that can be

generated, via some complex math, by the extended private key, which is

represented by your seed phrase.</p>
<p>The <strong>receive address</strong> in Bitcoin is an address that’s

designed for incoming transactions.</p>
<p>The <strong>change address</strong>, on the other hand, is

specifically set up for when you send bitcoin, and then receive change

back from the transaction. Because of some of the internals of bitcoin,

you almost always send a larger amount than what you want to spend. It

comes back as “change”, to one of the change addresses in your

wallet.</p>
<p>It’s like paying for a $1 pack of gum with a $100 bill, and receiving

$99 dollars back in change.</p>
<p>Almost all of your addresses in Bob are unused right now, except

for</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the one used for the first receive into the Alice wallet</p></li>
<li><p>one or more change addresses, that happen as a result of your

first send in this exercise</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="Header-1-without-numbers" id="exercise-8-review-the-alice-to-bob-transaction">Exercise 8: Review

the Alice to Bob transaction</h1>
<p>Let’s review the transaction you just made.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the Bob wallet, click on the blue

<strong>Transactions</strong> button on the left. There is a Balance at

the top of the Transactions. You can see the total either in Bitcoin or

sats. (A sat is a fraction of a bitcoin, each 1 bitcoin has 100 million

sats.)</p></li>
<li><p>Your transaction may not have any confirmations yet. As it gets

confirmations, the circle next to the Value begins to fill in. When it

gets 6 confirmations (in about one hour) it will be considered “final

settlement”, and the text for the transaction will switch from gray to

black.</p></li>
<li><p>To the right of the Balance label, <strong>click</strong>
<strong>on the actual number amount</strong>. Notice that the numbers

switch, from sats to BTC and back. My preference is to see the balance

in sats, because it’s easier to read small amounts. The transaction you

just made will be at the top.</p></li>
<li><p>You also see the transaction amount in USD (or whatever you have

set up as the currency in the Settings menu).</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Alice wallet and click on the blue Transactions button.

Again, the transaction you just made will be at the top. But it will not

show the exact amount that you sent in sats. Instead it will show more.

You spent more from Alice than what Bob received. The difference is the

fee you paid, to get the transaction processed.<br/>

How much was the fee for this transaction?</p></li>
<li><p>Still in the Alice wallet, hover your cursor on the transaction

date/time of the transaction you just made. There will be a little

magnifying glass to the right. <strong>Click on the magnifying

glass</strong>, to pop up transaction details.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>This screen is similar to what you saw in the previous exercise,

when you were creating the transaction. But now you’ll see a Blockchain

section at the bottom. (This is visible once the transaction has at

least one confirmation).</p></li>
<li><p>The Blockchain section shows you the status of the transaction,

how many confirmations there are, and also some information about the

block containing your transaction—the block height, and timestamp.<br/>

Also, below the Blockchain section you see a section with a lot of

colored numbers and letters, which is how the transaction appears in the

blockchain. You can ignore it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-permissionless-transactions">Learn more: permissionless

transactions</h3>
<p>You control both the Alice and Bob wallet, so sending a transaction

between them is just sending to yourself. But you could just as easily

have sent bitcoin to a wallet owned by someone else. It would have been

the exact same process.</p>
<p>There are only four things you need to make bitcoin transactions to

any corner of the globe.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bitcoin that you truly own, and have the private key for</p></li>
<li><p>Bitcoin wallet software</p></li>
<li><p>An internet connection</p></li>
<li><p>The bitcoin address you want to send to</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have these things, you can send bitcoin to anyone, anywhere,

anytime. The Bitcoin network is running 24/7.</p>
<p>One of the most important benefits of bitcoin is that no permission

is needed, in order to make transactions. Bitcoin is what’s called a

“bearer asset”. Whoever actually owns the bitcoin (in other words, has

the seed phrase/private key) can spend them, with no intermediaries like

government, banks or any other financial institution. In this way it’s

similar to cash or gold bars.</p>
<p>Government currencies like the US dollar—often called fiat

currencies—are tightly regulated. With government currencies, there are

many ways that you could be blocked from accessing your own money. For

example, during protests like the Canadian Truckers Protest, some

protesters, or those people who wanted to donate to protesters, found

their bank accounts frozen or restricted.</p>
<p>Also, transactions between different countries are frequently

controlled. These types of regulations are called capital controls. If

there’s a way for access to your money to be blocked, it’ll probably

happen at some point. Capital controls and events like the Canadian

Truckers Protest of 2022 have demonstrated that the only assets that

<em>truly</em> belong to you, are the ones that you control.</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s Bitcoin. And with Bitcoin, it’s impossible for

someone to prevent you from accessing and spending your bitcoin—assuming

you control your private keys.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-9-explore-the-settings-window-of-the-alice-wallet">Exercise

9: Explore the Settings window of the Alice wallet </h1>
<p>In this exercise, we’re going to get familiar with a few of the items

in the Settings window of the Alice wallet. We won’t go into all of

these settings in depth—this is just to get an overview of the settings

you’re most likely to use.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, make sure you have the Alice wallet open. The first

option is <strong>Policy Type</strong>. With Policy Type you can choose

between Single Signature and Multi Signature. Single Signature is the

most common and simplest, and that’s what we’ll be using in this

book.<br/>

Multi Signature is much more complex, and requires multiple different

private keys. It’s for people with significant assets in bitcoin, who

need more security.<br/>

(Warning: If you’re experimenting and switch to Multi Sig, it’ll look as

though you lost your seed. Just close and reopen the wallet, and it'll

be fine)</p></li>
<li><p>Next is <strong>Script Type</strong>. Native Segwit is what we’ll

be using now, and that’s the default in Sparrow and most bitcoin wallet

software. But it’s useful to know that using different or incorrect

script types can cause problems. This happens occasionally when trying

to restore a wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Descriptor</strong> is a way of encoding information

about your wallet, in a way that it can be easily transferred between

two different bitcoin wallet applications. We’ll be using it in upcoming

exercises.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside the Keystore area on the Settings window, you can click on

the <strong>View Seed</strong> button and easily see the seed phrase you

wrote down earlier.<br/>

This isn’t secure, of course, but since this is a low-risk wallet (both

temporary and containing only a small amount of bitcoin), you don’t need

to worry about it now. Later on, you’ll want more security, and we’ll

review other options.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Label</strong> is mostly a way of distinguishing

between different wallets. By default with this type of wallet, it’s set

to BIP39, but you can change it. It’s used mostly with Multi Signature

wallets.<br/>

The <strong>Master Fingerprint</strong> is similar to the Label, in that

it uniquely identifies the wallet. But Master Fingerprint is system

generated, as opposed to being something you can edit.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Derivation</strong> field is basically the method

that Sparrow uses, in order to figure out how to create addresses from

the seed phrase. We’ll mostly be using the default. But if you’re

recovering a wallet and the derivation for a wallet isn’t correct, then

the addresses won’t be correct either. And then no transactions will be

found.</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom, there’s a field labeled

<strong>xpub/zpub</strong>. This is usually called the <strong>public

key</strong>. We’ll be using it in the next exercise.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 class="Header-1-without-numbers" id="exercise-10-create-watch-only-wallet-based-on-alice">Exercise 10:

Create watch only wallet based on Alice</h1>
<p>In this exercise you’ll create a special kind of wallet, a watch only

wallet. It’ll be based on the Alice wallet you created earlier.</p>
<p>Why create a watch only wallet? The main reason is to keep your seed

phrase—that extremely important set of words—secure, private, and not

exposed very often.</p>
<p>In a watch only wallet you can do many of the tasks that you need to

do in a wallet, like receive bitcoin, and monitor transactions. The only

thing you can’t do is spend bitcoin.</p>
<p>It’s common to create a watch only wallet for your main wallet. A

watch only wallet is not a “hot wallet”. This means that it does

<em>not</em> hold your private key. And there’s no “View Seed” button in

the wallet, like we saw in exercise 9.</p>
<p>However, you can still see the transactions and addresses, though you

can’t spend. So, it’s more secure to have a watch only wallet set up on

your computer than it is to have an actual “hot” wallet, which is what

your Alice wallet is.</p>
<p>To create the wallet, follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Sparrow. Close all wallets except the Alice wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on File &gt; New Wallet. Name it “Alice Watch

Only”.</p></li>
<li><p>In the new wallet, you’ll end up on the Settings window. In the

Keystore section, click on <strong>xPub / Watch Only

Wallet</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, open your Alice wallet, if it’s not already open. Click on

the blue <strong>Settings</strong> button to go to the Settings window

in your Alice wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Keystores section of the Alice wallet, at the bottom, is

the xpub/zpub, which is the public key. <strong>Copy the public

key</strong>, and then switch to the Alice Watch Only wallet.

<strong>Paste it</strong> in the xpub/zpub text box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Apply,</strong> to create the Alice Watch Only

wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Wallet Password screen, click <strong>No

Password</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You’ve now successfully created a new watch only wallet in Sparrow.

You should be able to see, in the Transaction window of the Alice Watch

Only wallet, the same transactions that you see in the Alice wallet.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-public-keys-watch-only-wallets-and-privacy">Learn more:

Public keys, watch only wallets, and privacy</h3>
<p>A watch only wallet is created, as you saw above, with the public

key. Sometimes in more technical discussions, it’s called extended

public key, or master public key, but I’ll use the term public key in

this book.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, your public key is similar to an account number. From it,

you (or anyone) can generate addresses, and use those addresses to send

you bitcoin. And because they see your addresses, they can track your

transactions on those addresses.</p>
<p>Your public key is generated <em>from</em> your private key with some

complex math, but can't be reversed to reveal your private key. And

without your private key, your bitcoin cannot be spent. Still, you don’t

want to expose your public key, because anyone who knows it can track

all your bitcoin addresses, and all your transactions.</p>
<p>So, for the sake of privacy, make sure that you keep your public key

a secret.</p>
<p>One common use of watch only wallets is to generate receive

addresses. We’ll talk about this more in an upcoming exercise.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-11-explore-the-alice-watch-only-wallet">Exercise 11:

Explore the Alice Watch Only wallet</h1>
<p>In this exercise, we’ll explore the Alice Watch Only wallet, and

compare it with the original Alice wallet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, open the newly created Alice Watch Only wallet, and

also the original Alice wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Alice Watch Only wallet, click on the blue

<strong>Transactions</strong> button on the left. You should see two

transactions there. The first is when you received bitcoin from your

original source. The second is from sending bitcoin from Alice to

Bob.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for labels in the Transactions. Do you see any?</p></li>
<li><p>Now switch to the original Alice, and click the blue

<strong>Transactions</strong> button. You’ll see the two transactions

there, with identical amounts. What do the labels look like?</p></li>
<li><p>If the transactions are visible, then the Alice Watch Only wallet

should be set up correctly. But let’s check the addresses anyway. So,

switch to the original Alice wallet, and click on the blue

<strong>Addresses</strong> button on the left. Do the same in the Alice

Watch Only wallet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review</strong> that the first few Receive addresses are

identical, between the two wallets. If the addresses are identical, and

you see the previous transactions, then the watch only wallet is set up

correctly. (The labels will be missing on the watch only wallet, though,

just like they’re missing for the transactions.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-why-are-the-labels-missing">Learn more: Why are the

labels missing? </h3>
<p>Why do the labels only show up in the Alice wallet? It’s because the

label isn’t part of the bitcoin blockchain. The label is stored inside

the Sparrow wallet file, and not on the blockchain.</p>
<p>When you’re recovering a wallet from a seed phrase, or creating a

watch only wallet, all the information you see comes from the bitcoin

blockchain, because that’s where it’s fetched from. Recovering a wallet

from the seed phrase, or creating a watch only wallet—both of these will

generate a list of addresses. When those addresses are checked in the

bitcoin blockchain, it gives you any transactions (along with the

amounts and dates) associated with the addresses.</p>
<p>What you’re explicitly <em>not</em> getting is information that’s

stored in the Sparrow wallet file, such as labels from transactions or

addresses.</p>
<p>Here’s another thing to note about the label—the transaction gets the

label from the original address. For instance, when you set up your

initial receive transaction, from the exchange to your Alice wallet, you

entered a label for the receive address. This label shows up as the

label for the transaction as well.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-checking-receive-addresses">Learn more: checking receive

addresses</h3>
<p>The last step in this exercise was to compare addresses. What’s the

point of comparing the receive addresses between the Alice wallet, and

the Alice Watch Only wallet? You did the same thing in Exercise 5:

Recover your Alice wallet.</p>
<p>Here’s the reason you compare the addresses. If any of the settings

of the wallet are different (such as the script type, or derivation

path), then the addresses will be different. In order to make sure that

it’s set up correctly, you check to make sure that the first few

addresses are the same between the two wallets.</p>
<p>In this case, it’s not strictly necessary because you already see the

transactions in the watch only wallet. This means that Sparrow used the

correct addresses, and found the correct transactions. But it’s

definitely a good idea to remember to check addresses, whenever creating

a watch only wallet.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-12-receive-bitcoin-via-a-watch-only-wallet">Exercise

12: Receive bitcoin via a watch only wallet</h1>
<p>Getting receive addresses is one of the most important uses of a

watch only wallet. This exercise demonstrates how to receive bitcoin to

a wallet, without even having it open (and potentially exposed).</p>
<p>In order to do this, we use a watch only wallet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, open the Bob wallet, and the Alice Watch Only wallet.

Close all other wallets, especially the Alice wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the Alice Watch Only wallet. Click on the blue

<strong>Receive</strong> button on the left. For the Label field, type

in “Send from Bob to Alice Watch Only”. And now, copy the contents of

the Address field.</p></li>
<li><p>Now switch to the Bob wallet, and click the blue

<strong>Send</strong> button on the left. Into the Pay to field, paste

the address you just copied from Alice Watch Only. Type the same text in

the Label, “Send from Bob to Alice Watch Only”.</p></li>
<li><p>In Amount, enter the number of sats that you’ll be sending to

Alice Watch Only—about half of your balance.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Create Transaction</strong> on the bottom right. On

the next screen, click <strong>Finalize Transaction for

Signing.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Now click <strong>Sign</strong>, in the bottom right corner. Then

click <strong>Broadcast Transaction</strong>. Remember, if the Broadcast

Transaction button is not visible, you may need to reconnect with the

slider at the very bottom right.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This sends the transaction that you just created to the bitcoin

mempool. Because you have the two wallets that are involved in this

transaction open, you’ll get two pop-up notices from Sparrow. One will

have a negative amount for the Bob wallet, the other will have a

positive amount for the Alice Watch Only wallet.</p>
<p>From there, the transaction will soon get added to a block, and be

incorporated into the blockchain. You’ll receive two more notices (one

for each open wallet) when the first confirmation happens, usually in

around 10 minutes.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-receive-addresses-from-watch-only-wallets">Learn more:

Receive addresses from watch only wallets</h3>
<p>Getting receive addresses via a watch only wallet is very common. For

instance, say that somebody wants to pay you in bitcoin. If you have

your watch only wallet set up, you can give them a receive address,

using <em>only</em> the watch only wallet. You may want to do this

because as you acquire more bitcoin, you’ll set up your wallet much more

securely than your current wallets. You may have it hidden away

somewhere, or in a safe.</p>
<p>In general, you want to keep your bitcoin wallets secure, and that

means not opening them frequently. A watch only wallet, set up with the

public key of your main wallet, can prevent you from needing to open

your wallet just for a receive address.</p>
<p>Of course, before relying on a watch only wallet like this, make sure

that the watch only wallet is set up correctly. It’s important to check

that the receive addresses are identical to the original wallet.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-13-use-the-alice-watch-only-wallet-to-send-a-transaction">Exercise

13: Use the Alice Watch Only wallet to send a transaction</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll explore what happens when you try to

actually send a transaction, using the Alice Watch Only wallet. This

will deepen your understanding of the situations in which you might

choose to use watch only wallets.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Make sure the Alice wallet is closed. (If you don’t close it,

this exercise won’t show the expected results.)</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the Alice Watch Only and Bob wallets are open.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Bob wallet, click on the blue <strong>Receive</strong>

button on the left, and copy the Address that’s shown.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the Alice Watch Only wallet, and click on

<strong>Send</strong> on the left. In the Pay to field, paste the

receive address you got from the Bob wallet. Also add an amount—make it

about half of what’s currently in Alice. For Label, type in “Send via

Alice Watch Only”.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Create Transaction</strong> at the bottom right,

then <strong>Finalize Transaction for Signing</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now click <strong>Sign</strong>. What happens?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve done all the previous steps, Sparrow will pop up this

message “Connect Hardware Wallet”.</p>
<p>Here’s why this is happening. Sparrow is not able to provide signing

authority for the Alice Watch Only wallet, because it doesn’t have the

private key for it, since it’s a watch only wallet. Often, to provide a

private key to send from a watch only wallet, you would connect a

hardware wallet.</p>
<p>For a watch only wallet, Sparrow only has the public key, from which

it can look up the addresses associated with that key. But it cannot

sign any transactions to send from those addresses.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="try-again">Try again</h3>
<p>Now, try the exact same process, using the same steps above, with one

change—make sure the Alice wallet is <em>open</em>, instead of

closed.</p>
<p>Notice that when you’re on the screen that has the “Finalize

Transaction for Signing” button, there’s a “Signing Wallet” dropdown,

just above the button. Sparrow has determined that the Alice wallet has

signing authority, and makes it the default signing wallet, even if you

created the transaction from the watch only wallet.</p>
<p>Now, after you click Sign, Sparrow <em>does</em> allow you to sign.

If you choose to, you can continue and actually click <strong>Broadcast

Transaction</strong> to complete the transaction. Even though the

transaction was started from Alice Watch Only—as long as the Alice

wallet is open in Sparrow, it will be used to do the signing.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-14-create-wallet-bob-legacy-script-type">Exercise 14:

Create wallet Bob Legacy Script Type </h1>
<p>This exercise will show you what happens if you restore a wallet via

a saved seed phrase, but use a Script Type that’s different from what

the wallet was created with.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand this situation, because many people have

“lost” bitcoin, through recovering the wallet with the wrong script

type. The funds aren’t truly lost, it’s just that the wallet needs to be

set up correctly. Relying on another person to help you in this

situation introduces risk—it’s best to understand how to fix it

yourself.</p>
<p>The seed phrase you’ll be working with is the one for the Bob

wallet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Sparrow, and close all open wallets. Click on <strong>File

&gt; New Wallet</strong>. For the wallet name, type “Bob Legacy Script

Type”, and click <strong>Create Wallet</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next in the Settings window, for the first time we will change

one of the defaults. Click on <strong>Script Type</strong>, and choose

<strong>Legacy (P2PKH)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Below in the Keystores area of the Settings window, choose

<strong>New or imported software wallet</strong>. Now look for the

button on the top right that says Use 24 words and <strong>click the

arrow to the right.</strong> Choose <strong>Use 12 words</strong>

instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the 12 words you wrote down in the exercise “Create a

wallet in Sparrow—Bob”. Don’t create a passphrase. Click the

<strong>Create Keystore</strong> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave the derivation path at the default of m/44’/0’/0’. Note

that it’s different from the derivation path you saw in other wallets.

Click on <strong>Import Keystore</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now at the bottom right corner of your screen, click the

<strong>Apply</strong> button. On the next screen, click <strong>No

password</strong> on the Wallet Password screen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With these steps you’ve created another wallet, based on the Bob seed

phrase (private key). You’ve basically “recovered” a wallet, like you

did in a previous exercise.</p>
<p>However, this wallet uses a different script type. Let’s do some

checks here, to see how the script type affects the wallet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open up the original Bob wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the blue Transactions button in the original Bob wallet,

and compare the transactions to those in the new Bob Legacy Script Type

wallet. What do you see?</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the addresses in Bob to the Bob Legacy Script Type

wallet. Notice that they’re in a different format. In the original Bob

wallet, they all start with bc1. Also, the rest of the address is

different as well.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Transactions screen in the new wallet should be empty, with a

zero balance. Even though you used the same exact seed phrase, the

addresses are different if the script type is different. Sparrow checks

the blockchain only for those addresses that it knows about. And it uses

the script type to generate the addresses, so it gets different

addresses when the script type is different.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-script-type-problems">Learn

more: Script type problems</h3>
<p>The most important thing to remember about script type is that

whenever you’re recovering a wallet, or using a watch only wallet, you

<em>must</em> match the script type (and other settings, like the

Derivation) with the original wallet.</p>
<p>Bitcoin script types define address formats and spending rules. The

default now, in 2025, is Native Segwit, but earlier it was

different.</p>
<p>This should happen by default, in most modern bitcoin wallet

software, but it’s best to check.</p>
<p>This situation—having different script types when you’re trying to

recover a wallet—has caused many people anxiety. Maybe you <em>know</em>

that you wrote down and entered the seed phrase correctly, but you just

don’t see any transactions when you know there should be some.</p>
<p>But it may be that when you created your wallet, the software you

used had one particular default script type. And then in the software

you used to recover it, the default script type is different. That

causes the addresses to be different, which causes the transactions to

not be found. When the transactions can’t be found, your wallet shows a

balance of zero.</p>
<p>You won’t have an exercise on this, but the derivation setting is

similar to script type. If you restore your wallet with an incorrect

derivation, you will get different addresses, and will not see your

bitcoin.</p>
<p>It’s important to know that getting the Script Type or Derivation

wrong is not bad in the same way as losing your seed phrase. If you have

completely lost your seed phrase, there is no chance at all of

recovering your bitcoin. But if there’s a script type mismatch, you just

need to fix that one thing, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-15-create-wallet-alice-with-passphrase">Exercise 15:

Create wallet Alice With Passphrase</h1>
<p>In this exercise, we’ll be exploring what happens when you add a

passphrase on top of your seed phrase.</p>
<p>Remember, the passphrase is different from the password. A passphrase

actually <em>changes</em> your private key. It’s as though you had a

completely different seed phrase. But the password, in Sparrow, just

unlocks the wallet file so it can be opened.</p>
<p>Awareness of the potential complexity of a passphrase in bitcoin goes

a long way in avoiding problems.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Sparrow. Close all other wallets, and go to <strong>File

&gt; New Wallet</strong>. For the wallet name, type “Alice With

Passphrase”, and click <strong>Create Wallet</strong>. Leave everything

at the defaults in the Settings window.</p></li>
<li><p>Below in the Keystores area of the Settings window, choose

<strong>New or imported software wallet.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In the top right of the next window, look for the button that

says Use 24 words and <strong>click the arrow to the right.</strong>

Choose <strong>Use 12 words</strong> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the 12 words you wrote down in the step “Create a wallet in

Sparrow—Alice”.</p></li>
<li><p>Here’s the critical step—this time, go ahead and <strong>click

the “Use passphrase?” checkbox</strong>, at the bottom of the words you

wrote down. A window titled “Add a passphrase?” will pop up, with some

warning text. Sparrow will ask you to confirm that you want to create a

passphrase. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm.</p></li>
<li><p>Now enter your passphrase. The passphrase is not limited to the

BIP39 word list, you can type anything you want in there, including

numbers and symbols. It’s also case-sensitive. For now, keep it simple

by putting in “<strong>MyPassphrase1234</strong>”. Write down the

passphrase on a sheet of paper, and label it “Passphrase for wallet

Alice With Passphrase”.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Create Keystore</strong> button, then the

<strong>Import Keystore</strong> button. You’ll be asked to re-enter the

passphrase. Re-enter and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now at the bottom right corner of your screen, click the

<strong>Apply</strong> button. On the next screen, click <strong>No

password</strong> on the “Wallet Password” screen. (Remember, this is

the <em>password</em> on the wallet file, it’s not the

<em>passphrase</em>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Now click on the Transactions button. Do you see any

transactions? There should be none.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-passphrase-and-password">Learn

more: passphrase and password</h3>
<p>The reason you don’t see transactions in the step above is that with

the passphrase on the original seed phrase, you’ve created a completely

different private key, with different addresses. When Sparrow looks up

those addresses on the blockchain, there’s no transactions associated

with them.</p>
<p>The <em>password</em> (as opposed to passphrase), in Sparrow, is just

an extra piece of security that you can put on your wallet file. If you

lose the password, but still have the seed phrase, you can easily

restore the wallet.</p>
<p>In contrast, the passphrase is a special concept in bitcoin. When you

create a wallet with a certain seed phrase, and no passphrase, you

generate a specific private key. But when you create a wallet with the

exact same seed phrase, and add a passphrase, you get a completely

different private key.</p>
<p>Beginners and experts alike often have problems with passphrases. It

can seem like a good idea to get some extra security on the seed

phrase.</p>
<p>But apparently this particular issue—setting up a passphrase and then

forgetting it—is <em>the most common problem</em> that causes people to

lose their bitcoin in self custody. People think they’ll always remember

the passphrase, then their memory fails them.</p>
<p>The bottom line? <strong>Don’t use a passphrase unless you’re an

expert</strong>, and completely understand the risks.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-16-review-some-transactions">Exercise 16: Review some

transactions </h1>
<p>In this exercise we’ll be reviewing some of the transactions that

have occurred, and learning more about how transactions work. You don’t

need to know every single detail on this topic, this is just to get an

overview.</p>
<p>Understanding how transactions work will give you a better grasp of

how to begin optimizing for lower fees and privacy.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="review-your-initial-transaction-into-the-alice-wallet">Review your

initial transaction into the Alice wallet</h3>
<p>Let’s take a more detailed look at the very first transaction that

you made, when you received your first bitcoin into the Alice

wallet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, open the Alice wallet. Click on the blue

<strong>Transactions button</strong> on the top left in Sparrow. Go to

your earliest transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Hover your cursor over the date of that transaction, and a little

magnifying glass will pop up on the right. Click on the

<strong>magnifying glass</strong> to view details about the

transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>The fee is at the bottom. The fee is what’s left after the

recipients have been paid, and the change has gone back to the change

address. The fee goes to the bitcoin miners.</p></li>
<li><p>If you purchased the bitcoin from an exchange, it can look

somewhat complex. It’s likely that there will be one input (from your

exchange), and many outputs, as the exchange splits the payments to many

different people’s addresses.<br/>

One of these outputs is the one you received, into your address. Your

output has a downward pointing arrow icon, the others have what looks

like a paper airplane.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="explore-an-address-in-mempool.space">Explore an address in

Mempool.space </h3>
<p>Now you’re going to use the blockchain explorer <a href="https://mempool.space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mempool.space</a> to view

transactions. What exactly is a blockchain explorer? It’s a website that

allows users to view everything that’s available on the bitcoin

blockchain, like transactions, addresses, etc. Mempool.space is the most

well-known bitcoin blockchain explorer. Another blockchain explorer is

Blockstream.info.</p>
<p>This exercise helps you gain a fresh perspective on blockchain data.

By reviewing transactions through a tool other than Sparrow, you develop

a clearer understanding of the blockchain. It reinforces the idea that

the transactions you’re seeing are part of a global network powered by

tens of thousands of bitcoin nodes, all working together to maintain the

blockchain network’s stability.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to Sparrow, where you have the transaction open for the very

first bitcoin you received into Alice. Go to your receive address (the

one with a downward pointing arrow icon). Right-click (or Control-click

on a Mac), and then click on <strong>Copy Address</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Now in a browser, go to <a href="https://mempool.space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mempool.space/</a>. In the top

right, where it says Explore the full Bitcoin ecosystem, <strong>paste

in the Address</strong> you just copied. Click the <strong>magnifying

glass</strong> to the right, to run the search.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll see a screen full of information about your receive

address. It has the current balance, which may not be the same as the

original one. You may see more than one transaction, related to this

bitcoin address.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the Address section, there will be a Transactions section.

It will probably say <strong>2 of 2 Transactions</strong>. Click on the

<strong>Transaction ID</strong> that’s the same as the TXID you saw

earlier in Sparrow. This should also be the <em>earliest</em>

transaction for that address.</p></li>
<li><p>In Mempool.space <strong>find the number of

confirmations</strong> for that transaction. This should be identical to

what you see for the same transaction, in Sparrow. The Block (called

Block Height in Sparrow, the number of the block that the transaction

got into) should also be the same between Mempool.space and

Sparrow.<br/>

The timestamp may not be identical, because of time zone

differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down in Mempool.space to the Flow section. This is where

you get a comprehensive layout of the entire transaction, with all

inputs, all outputs, and fees. Your address will be among the

outputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that you can see, in the Flow section, any additional

transactions that your address (and other addresses that were in the

transaction) were involved in.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-never-reuse-bitcoin-addresses">Learn more: Never reuse

bitcoin addresses</h3>
<p>As you saw in the exercise above, it’s simple to track bitcoin, if

you know the bitcoin address. The fact that no history is lost in the

bitcoin blockchain is another reason to be careful about your privacy.

One of the ways to improve your privacy in bitcoin is to never use a

bitcoin address more than once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never reuse bitcoin addresses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone happens to know one of your bitcoin addresses, and if you

use that address again and again, they know exactly how much bitcoin you

have in it. They also know when you received it, and how much you

received in each transaction.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most modern bitcoin wallet software makes it difficult

to reuse a bitcoin address. For instance, in Sparrow, when you click

Receive, you are given a new receive address, and not one that you’ve

used before.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-expanding-on-the-blockchain">Learn more: Expanding on the

Blockchain </h3>
<p>In a previous exercise, you learned some of the essentials about the

bitcoin blockchain. It’s basically a public ledger, stored and

duplicated on an enormous, decentralized network of computers running

bitcoin software, all around the world. It records every single bitcoin

transaction that has ever taken place, in chronological order. In it you

can see all the addresses in the transactions, and the amount of bitcoin

associated with each address. And also, it’s completely open to the

public—if you had a spare computer, you could run a bitcoin node in your

home.</p>
<p>About every 10 minutes on the blockchain, a new block is added on top

of the last block. This has been happening with almost 100% reliability

ever since bitcoin was first started up in January 2009. When a new

block is created and attached to the bitcoin blockchain, it’s like a new

link on a metal chain—the new block is attached to the previous block

via a mathematical fingerprint.</p>
<p>There’s a popular saying among bitcoiners, “Tick tock, next

block”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tick tock, next block</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This saying captures the mindset of bitcoiners. The price might be up

or down, but Bitcoin will keep on going. And it will gradually but

steadily replace other types of money. No government or corporation in

the world can stop bitcoin from being transacted, and new blocks from

being added to the blockchain.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-17-send-bitcoin-from-alice-to-bobreview-fees">Exercise

17: Send bitcoin from Alice to Bob—review fees</h1>
<p>In this exercise you’ll again send some bitcoin from Alice to Bob.

Along the way and in the next exercise, we’ll look at fees in more

detail. You want to minimize fees in your transactions, and the next

exercises will teach you some fundamentals of bitcoin fees.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open both the Bob wallet and the Alice wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Bob wallet, click on the blue <strong>Receive</strong>

button on the left. In the Label field, type in “receive from Alice”.

Then go to the Address field, and copy it.</p></li>
<li><p>In Alice, click on the <strong>Send</strong> button on the left.

In the “Pay to” text box, paste the receive address that you just

copied. In the Label, type “Send to Bob”. In the Amount field, enter

about half the bitcoin you have in Alice.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, let’s do some experimentation with fees and amounts to get a

sense of how they work.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the website <a href="https://mempool.space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mempool.space/</a> and look at

what the estimated transaction fees are, on the bottom left. They range

from No Priority to High Priority.</p></li>
<li><p>Back in Sparrow, take a look at the Fee field. What is the fee?

By default, it appears that Sparrow tries to set the fee amount to get

your transaction in the “High” or “Medium” priority range. Sparrow is

receiving information about the current bitcoin market rate fees from

mempool.space, in order to make these recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the transaction amount, make it as low as possible. Does

Sparrow allow you to spend more on the fee, than you do on the

transaction?</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a slider going from 1 to 50+, to the right of the label

<strong>Blocks</strong>. Sparrow often starts out with a setting of 4

blocks—in other words, it sets a transaction fee that’s as low as

possible, while still getting the transaction in the blockchain sometime

within the next 4 blocks (approximately 40 minutes).</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Experiment with this slider. Unless fees are already very low,

try moving it to the right, so that it takes longer, but the fees are

lower. Only do this for transactions that are not urgent.</p></li>
<li><p>After these experiments, you’re ready to actually create the

transaction. But first, switch the Amount back to the original amount

(about half of what you have in Alice).<br/>

In the bottom right corner, click <strong>Create Transaction</strong>.

Then click <strong>Finalize Transaction for Signing</strong>, and then

<strong>Sign</strong> button. By clicking Sign, you’re authorizing the

transaction, with your private key.</p></li>
<li><p>Now click the <strong>Broadcast Transaction</strong> button.

You’ve just sent the transaction to the bitcoin mempool. You’ll get the

same pop-up messages that you’ve received before in Sparrow, when

sending a transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the latest transactions in the Transactions window, in both

the Alice wallet and the Bob wallet. You should see the transaction you

just made, in both wallets. They will be in light gray instead of black,

until they’re confirmed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Learn more: Amounts too small to usefully

spend—“dust”</strong></p>
<p>In Step 4, you experimented with lowering the transaction amount—did

you notice Sparrow lets you spend more on fees than the actual

transaction amount? While possible, you should generally avoid this.</p>
<p>Amounts too small to spend economically are called “dust”. Dust

happens when leftover Bitcoin (UTXOs) becomes worthless to move, because

the fees exceed the value. It’s like packaging up and mailing a penny,

but spending $1 on postage. Whether or not a chunk of bitcoin is “dust”

depends on how high transaction fees are at the time.</p>
<p>If you're interested, consider exploring this topic online (search

for UTXO and dust).</p>
<h1 id="exercise-18-bitcoin-feeswhat-you-pay-and-why">Exercise 18:

Bitcoin fees—what you pay, and why</h1>
<p>Now’s a good time to learn more about bitcoin fees. Transaction fees,

of course, directly affect how much you need to pay to process your

bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>This is a good time to remember that we’re paying fees all the time,

to process our transactions. For instance, when you use a regular credit

card at a grocery store, you’re usually paying around 2 to 5% in fees.

We think that it’s the merchant who’s paying the fees, but in the end,

it all comes from the customers.</p>
<p>The good thing about bitcoin fees is that unlike credit card fees,

it’s not a percentage of the transaction amount. Instead, it’s based on

how much digital space the transaction would take in a block. So, you

could potentially transfer huge amounts of bitcoin for a tiny fee.</p>
<p>The metric for the transaction fee in bitcoin is sats/vByte, or

sat/vB. A low transaction fee rate would be 1 or 2 sats/vByte.

Occasionally, transaction fees can go up very high, but transaction fees

are low now (early 2025).</p>
<p>The front page of the website <a href="https://mempool.space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mempool.space</a> has good

information on what the current fee rates are. It’s divided up into No

priority, Low Priority, Medium Priority, and High priority. The High

priority ones will usually make it into the next block.</p>
<p>Mempool.space also has great historical information on fees. To

access it, go to <a href="https://mempool.space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mempool.space/</a> and then click

the white Graph icon at the top, then the blue Mining dropdown on the

left, and choose Block Fee Rates. Or you can go directly to <a href="https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates</a>.</p>
<p>Do some exploration on the Block Fee Rates page, using the time

ranges at the top right (24h, 3D, 1W, etc.), and the bar sliders on the

bottom, to learn more about bitcoin fees. Answer the following

questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the past 24 hours, at around what time were the highest fees

paid? How about the lowest?</p></li>
<li><p>For the past month, when were the lowest fees paid?</p></li>
<li><p>When were some notable spikes in bitcoin transaction fees,

looking at all of the historical data you have available?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes it’s hard to see the overall patterns because of seemingly

random spikes in the fees. Often there’s a spike when there’s a lot of

interest in bitcoin and the price is appreciating. Another cause may be

NFTs and Ordinals (see below for more info), which are digital items

that can cause congestion on the bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>In some of the following exercises, you’ll experiment with different

fee rates.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-bitcoin-transactions-that-are-not-on-the-blockchain">Learn

more: Bitcoin transactions that are not on the blockchain</h3>
<p>It’s important to know that not all transactions have to be logged

directly on the bitcoin blockchain. There are other options for sending

and receiving bitcoin, on what’s called Layer 2. These transactions are

not directly or immediately on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The most popular Layer 2 is the Lightning network. Most smaller

bitcoin transactions happen on the Lightning network. There’s more

information about Lightning in the <a href="#resources">Resources</a>

chapter at the end of this book.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-nfts-ordinals-and-runes">Learn

more: NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes</h3>
<p>When Bitcoin transaction fees spike up, it’s usually from either

increased interest in bitcoin, or increased interest in NFTs, Ordinals,

and Runes.</p>
<p>NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes are digital items that live on the bitcoin

blockchain. Some fans like to buy and trade them—the hope is that like

trading cards, they may appreciate in value.</p>
<p>These items take up much more space on the block than a regular

transaction, so they make regular transactions expensive. Trading in

NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes tends to come in waves. You can see (on

mempool.space) a huge spike in bitcoin transaction fees in late 2023 and

early 2024. This was caused by trading in NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-paying-the-lowest-fees-possible">Learn more: Paying the

lowest fees possible</h3>
<p>For practical purposes, here’s what you need to remember about

bitcoin transaction fees:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the past few years (2024-2025), bitcoin fees have been

generally low. They probably won’t cause you much concern.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, for low transaction fees, do them in the morning on

weekends. There’s not as many transactions happening, so competition is

lower. Sunday morning in the Eastern Standard time zone can be

particularly cheap—you can check historical fees and see that fees at

this time are usually low.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t want your transaction to go through immediately, you

don’t have to pay the recommended fee amount. In periods of high

transaction fees, I’ve input a lower fee, and the transaction has still

gone through. It will just take longer, I’ve waited anywhere from an

hour to a week.<br/>

But remember, if a transaction needs to happen quickly, you need to pay

the fee to get it included in the next block.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a stuck transaction because you set the transaction

fee too low, there are some options. One of them is what’s called a RBF

(Replace By Fee), another is CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). We won’t get

into the details here, but do a search online for either term, along

with the keyword Sparrow, and you’ll find some information.<br/>
<strong>Warning</strong>: I just did the same search that I mentioned

above, and the fake, look-alike scam site came up in the search results

(sparrowwallet.net). Always be careful where you’re clicking!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Well done!</strong></p>
<p>You've completed the advanced beginner exercises, and have developed

a good understanding of some important concepts in bitcoin—and of course

practical skills.</p>

<h1 id="exercise-19-install-blue-wallet-and-create-the-carol-wallet">Exercise

19: Install Blue Wallet and create the Carol wallet</h1>
<p>Your next exercise is to install the Blue Wallet app on your phone,

and create a new wallet with it. Blue Wallet is a widely used bitcoin

wallet that has a long track record.</p>
<p>Why bother working with another wallet? Wouldn’t it be easier to just

stick with Sparrow, since you’ve learned so much about it? Yes, it would

be easier. But you wouldn’t learn as much. And you wouldn’t have

practiced your ability to restore a seed phrase and test a wallet in an

entirely different system. And that’s a <em>very</em> important skill to

have, and practice regularly.</p>
<p>Also, learning how a different type of wallet software operates will

solidify your understanding of some of the basic concepts of

bitcoin—private keys, addresses, and transactions. Comparing two

different products helps illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>Blue Wallet is mostly a mobile wallet, but also has a desktop version

for MacOS. We’ll use it on the phone to generate a new wallet, Carol.

Just like Alice and Bob, Carol represents a new user of bitcoin. Then

we’ll send bitcoin to Carol, and do some other exercises.</p>
<p>Go to the website (<a href="https://bluewallet.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://bluewallet.io/</a>). Towards the

bottom there are links to install it via Google Play or the Apple App

Store. Also, you can install it directly on an Android phone, via the

APK.</p>
<p>Choose whichever mobile option you prefer, and complete the install.

The version that I installed was 7.1.6.</p>
<p>Now, set up the Carol wallet using the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On a fresh install of Blue Wallet, you’ll see an <strong>Add

now</strong> button, to start a new wallet. Click it.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Name field at the top, type

<strong>Carol</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s an option to choose between a regular Bitcoin wallet, and

a Multisig Vault—basically between a single sig wallet, and a multisig

wallet. Keep the default of Bitcoin, and click

<strong>Create</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the next screen “Your wallet has been created”, you’re

presented with the seed phrase (Blue Wallet refers to it as a mnemonic

phrase). <strong>Write them down</strong> on a sheet of paper, labeled

Carol Seed Phrase. Keep this paper safe.<br/>
<strong>Warning</strong>: Blue Wallet does <em>not</em> ask you to check

your seed phrase, unlike Sparrow. Be sure to double check that you wrote

it down correctly, because it’s easy to be careless. I just made this

mistake myself. One of my words was “two”, and for some reason I wrote

down “too” instead of “two”. I would have been without a good backup.

Luckily, I had a feeling that I was going too quickly, so I

double-checked and figured it out in time.</p></li>
<li><p>To make it easier to read amounts, switch from the default, of

using BTC as the unit, to sats. To do this, click on the Carol wallet to

bring it up. Click on the label that says BTC to the right of the amount

field. This will switch between BTC, sats, and USD (or whatever currency

you have set up in the Settings).</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-blue-wallet">Learn more: Blue

Wallet</h3>
<p>Notice that Blue Wallet has many fewer options than Sparrow. There’s

only one option for the number of words in your seed phrase (12). And

the script type (which Blue Wallet calls Type) is not customizable. You

can view the Type, Addresses, and other settings by clicking the three

dots in the top right corner, when the wallet is open.</p>
<p>But Blue Wallet is very straightforward to use, and probably has all

the functionality you need for a mobile phone wallet. Like Sparrow, Blue

Wallet is also open source, which means that the code is publicly

available for review (<a href="https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet</a>).</p>
<p>Here’s a security tip to keep in mind: Whenever you install any

bitcoin related software, be very sure that the site you’re installing

it from is the real one. For Sparrow, you went to the right site—<a href="https://SparrowWallet.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://SparrowWallet.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re downloading an app, make sure it’s the real thing as well.

Often scammer apps will get onto the Google Play Store, or Apple App

Store. These apps are designed to look just like the real app. Always

double-check with reputable people or established websites to be sure

you’re installing the real thing.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-what-is-logged-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain">Learn more:

what is logged in the bitcoin blockchain?</h3>
<p>In this exercise you created a new wallet in Blue Wallet. Consider

for a moment—is there anything in the bitcoin blockchain, right now,

that registers that this wallet has been created?</p>
<p>No, there’s not. This step just creates the wallet in Blue Wallet.

You’ve basically just had Blue Wallet create a very large random number

for you—your private key, encoded by your seed phrase. You could do this

even without an internet connection.</p>
<p>But no actual transactions have taken place. And it’s only the

transactions that are broadcast, and logged in the blockchain. The

creation of a wallet is not logged in the blockchain.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-20-send-bitcoin-from-bob-in-sparrow-to-carol-in-blue-wallet">Exercise

20: Send bitcoin from Bob in Sparrow to Carol in Blue Wallet</h1>
<p>In this exercise, Bob will send some bitcoin to Carol. To simulate

this, you’ll transfer from the Bob wallet in Sparrow to the Carol wallet

in Blue Wallet. This will be your first transaction into the Carol

wallet.</p>
<p>It will also be your first time transacting with a new bitcoin wallet

application. These transactions between different bitcoin applications

help you learn how to do the essentials using different systems, and

strengthen your understanding of Bitcoin as a whole.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="preparing-the-transaction">Preparing the

transaction </h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, open the Bob wallet, and click on the

<strong>Send</strong> button. Close all other wallets.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the Blue Wallet app on your phone. Click on the

<strong>Carol</strong> wallet. It will have zero transactions. Click the

<strong>Receive</strong> button at the bottom. You’ll see a QR code, and

the matching bitcoin address below that.</p></li>
<li><p>When getting the address from Blue Wallet to Sparrow, it’s

easiest to use your computer’s webcam, to scan the QR code for the

receive address. Switch back to Sparrow. You scan the QR code by

<strong>clicking the icon of a camera</strong>, to the right of the “Pay

to” text box. Then put your phone screen in front of the webcam, so the

webcam can see your phone and <strong>scan the QR</strong> code. You’ll

have to experiment with moving your phone around in front of the

computer webcam, so it can be read.<br/>

If your computer doesn’t have a webcam, you can get the bitcoin address

from the phone to the computer via sharing (in email, or whatever you

normally use). But if possible, use the QR code, it’s easier and more

private.</p></li>
<li><p>For the <strong>Amount</strong> to send from Bob to Carol, choose

about half of the amount of bitcoin that you have in Bob. And instead of

sending a rounded amount—for instance, 50,000 sats—remember to send

something like 50,924.</p></li>
<li><p>In Sparrow, label the transaction <strong>Send to Carol on Blue

Wallet</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue in Sparrow to follow all the steps you normally do when

sending bitcoin. Click <strong>Create Transaction</strong>, then click

<strong>Finalize Transaction for Signing</strong>, then

<strong>Sign.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Before you click Broadcast Transaction, you can review everything

about the transaction in the screen above. This can be a good practice

in general, to make sure you have the fee and the receive address

correct.<br/>

Once you’ve checked, click <strong>Broadcast

Transaction</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="review-the-transaction-in-blue-wallet">Review the transaction in

Blue Wallet </h3>
<p>As the transaction gets processed, you can check it in Blue

Wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Just after the send from Sparrow, you may get a “pending”

notification in Blue Wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Carol wallet. A transaction should show up in Blue

Wallet, once it’s confirmed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the transaction doesn’t show up, especially after Sparrow

shows that it’s been confirmed, you may need to close and reopen Blue

Wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the new transaction in Blue Wallet. On that screen, you

can click on the Details button at the top right. That will give you

extra info about the transaction, like the input address, output

addresses, etc. It should match exactly what you see in the transaction

details, in Sparrow.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="exercise-21-send-bitcoin-from-your-exchange-to-blue-wallet-carol">Exercise

21: Send bitcoin from your exchange to Blue Wallet Carol </h1>
<p>When you first moved bitcoin from your exchange to your own wallet on

Sparrow, you sent about half the amount you purchased on the exchange.

This time, you will move the other half, and leave zero bitcoin on the

exchange.</p>
<p>In the below instructions, I’m using Strike, on my phone. These are

just example instructions—if you’re not using Strike, the sending

process will be different from your exchange.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I open Blue Wallet on my phone, and open the Carol

wallet</p></li>
<li><p>I click the <strong>Receive</strong> button on the bottom. A QR

code will pop up, along with the bitcoin address that the QR code points

to (starting with bc1). Next, I click on the <strong>bitcoin

address</strong>. This will automatically copy it to the

clipboard.</p></li>
<li><p>Back in the Strike app, I make sure I’m in the Bitcoin section,

by clicking <strong>Bitcoin</strong> in the bottom left. I scroll down

in the screen and click the <strong>Send button</strong>, then I click

on <strong>Bitcoin Wallet.</strong> (The other option is Username, which

is an internal Strike send.)</p></li>
<li><p>Still in Strike, I click <strong>Paste</strong> at the bottom, to

paste in the bitcoin address I copied from Blue Wallet. (There’s also

the option to scan a QR code for the bitcoin address here, which I

ignore because I’m using two phone apps).</p></li>
<li><p>The next screen in Strike is for the amount. I click the

<strong>Max</strong> button to transfer the entire amount. Next is the

screen to “Select delivery time”, where you can choose Priority,

Standard, or Flexible. To avoid high fees, I choose the

<strong>Flexible</strong> option for the transfer, which is free in

Strike, but of course takes longer. Then I click

<strong>Next</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The final screen is Confirm send. Click <strong>Confirm</strong>.

The transaction will either go through very quickly, or be in a pending

status for a while, depending on the priority you choose.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now get a notification about receiving bitcoin in Blue

Wallet. This depends on how quickly your transaction happens, and

whether you’ve set up Blue Wallet to receive notifications.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-22-import-the-alice-wallet-to-blue-wallet-via-the-public-key">Exercise

22: Import the Alice wallet to Blue Wallet via the public key</h1>
<p>In this exercise we’ll take the public key from Sparrow, and use it

to create a new watch only wallet in Blue Wallet. You’ll learn how this

works in general, and some of the pitfalls to avoid in the process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In Sparrow, close any other wallets and open the Alice wallet.

Click on the <strong>Settings</strong> button.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Keystores section at the bottom, look to the right of the

xpub/zpub field for the QR code symbol. Click on the <strong>QR code

symbol</strong>, to pop it up for this xpub.</p></li>
<li><p>Now open Blue Wallet, on your phone. Click on the <strong>plus

symbol</strong> in the top right corner, to add a wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Skip the Name field, and do not click the Create button. Instead,

at the very bottom, click <strong>Import</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Import screen, at the bottom, click the <strong>Scan or

import a file</strong> button. On your computer, go back to the QR code

you brought up in Sparrow, and scan it.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue Wallet immediately creates a new watch only wallet for you,

with the xpub you imported by scanning. If the transactions don’t appear

within a few minutes, close and reopen the app and you should see

them.<br/>

The name of the wallet will be Imported Watch-only, it’s okay to leave

it like that.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you see transactions in this watch only wallet? You should

have the same transactions that you see in the Alice wallet in

Sparrow.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-different-derivation-paths-different-address">Learn More:

Different derivation paths = different address</h3>
<p>In an older version of Blue Wallet, the steps you just went through

would not have worked. You wouldn’t have seen any transactions. This was

because if you imported an xpub in Blue Wallet, the wallet would have

been set up with a different script type and derivation path. This means

the transactions would never have shown up, because different addresses

would have been generated.</p>
<p>This caused lots of problems and stress for people who set up a watch

only wallet to get receive addresses. They did this to easily receive

bitcoin, while not having their seed phrase in Blue Wallet.</p>
<p>But if they used a receive address that they copied from Blue Wallet,

the transaction would never have shown up in Sparrow because of the

difference in derivation path.</p>
<p>Happily, this problem has now been resolved by Blue Wallet. But

always remember to do some checking when setting up a watch only

wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there are existing transactions in the wallet, you should be

able to see them. If you can’t, there’s a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that the first few addresses are the same. You know where

to find the addresses in Sparrow. In Blue Wallet, click on the three

dots at the top right, and then click on Show Addresses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before the next exercise, the wallet that you just created needs to

be deleted. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click on the wallet to open it (the name will be Imported

Watch-only).</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the three dots in the top right corner, to get to the

settings screen. Click on the three dots in the top right corner again,

and you’ll find a red Delete option. Click it.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue Wallet will ask you to confirm. Click “YES, DELETE” to

confirm.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="exercise-23-import-the-alice-wallet-to-blue-wallet-via-the-descriptor">Exercise

23: Import the Alice wallet to Blue Wallet via the descriptor</h1>
<p>Now you’ll take the public key from Sparrow via the descriptor field,

and use it to create a new watch only wallet.</p>
<p>The descriptor in Sparrow is like an expanded version of the public

key, which gives complete details about the setup of the wallet. Not

only does it include the public key (xpub/zpub), it also includes the

derivation path, the script type, etc. It makes interoperability between

different wallet applications much easier.</p>
<p>When creating a watch only wallet, use the descriptor when possible.

This means you don’t need to worry about compatibility, and matching all

the settings exactly.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Blue Wallet, on your phone. Click on the <strong>plus

symbol</strong> in the top right corner, to add a wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore everything but the <strong>Import wallet</strong> button

at the very bottom. Click on it.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Import screen, at the bottom, click the <strong>Scan or

import a file</strong> button.</p></li>
<li><p>On your computer, go back to the QR code you brought up in

Sparrow, and scan it with your phone.<br/>

If you have a problem scanning it, try changing the density of the QR

code (with the Decrease Density/Increase Density button at the

bottom).</p></li>
<li><p>Blue Wallet immediately creates a new watch only wallet for you,

with the descriptor you imported by scanning. If the transactions don’t

appear within a few minutes, close and reopen the app and you should see

them.</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the wallet will be Imported Watch-only, and it’s okay

to leave it like that.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Do you see transactions in this watch only wallet? You should have

the exact same transactions that you see in the Alice wallet in Sparrow,

just like with the previous exercise.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-24-set-up-password-protection-on-blue-wallet">Exercise

24: Set up password protection on Blue Wallet</h1>
<p>Blue Wallet offers a password feature similar to Sparrow. However,

it’s not exactly the same because in Sparrow, you’re putting the

password on one wallet file. In Blue Wallet, though, you’re putting the

password on the whole application. Having a password on Blue Wallet

gives you an extra layer of security.</p>
<p>Note that the password on Blue Wallet is not like a passphrase. It

does not change the private key, and you can still restore the wallet

using just the seed phrase, in case you lose or forget your Blue Wallet

password.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to set a password on Blue Wallet:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Blue Wallet and make sure you’re in the home screen, where

all the available wallets are shown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Click the three dots</strong> in the top right corner,

and choose Security.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable the option for <strong>Encrypted and Password

Protected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue Wallet will give you a confirmation screen (about only

protecting the data on your phone, and not actually the seed phrase).

Click <strong>I Understand</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, enter a secure password, then re-enter it, and click

<strong>OK</strong>. Your Blue Wallet data on your phone is now

encrypted and password protected. Be sure to keep the password safe.

(But remember, you can still restore the wallet with the backed up seed

phrase).</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more">Learn more</h3>
<p>What are you actually protecting in this step? You’re protecting the

data linked with Blue Wallet on your phone. So if your phone were lost

or stolen, anyone who has the phone wouldn’t be able to access your Blue

Wallet data (depending on how secure your password is).</p>
<p>But it <em>only</em> provides protection for the Blue Wallet data on

your phone. What it is <em>not</em> doing is providing any sort of

protection for your seed phrase, outside of the phone.</p>
<p>For instance, assume you back up your seed phrase in a secure

location, as you should. However, someone with bad intentions still

finds that seed phrase. In that situation, the fact that you have a

password on Blue Wallet doesn’t help you. Anyone with the backup seed

phrase could just restore it to another wallet software, and steal your

funds.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-25-recover-the-bob-wallet-in-blue-wallet">Exercise 25:

Recover the Bob wallet in Blue Wallet</h1>
<p>In this exercise you’ll practice an emergency recovery, recreating

the Bob wallet (created in Sparrow) onto the Blue Wallet app on your

phone. In any bitcoin wallet software you use, you should always

practice an emergency recovery. That way, if the emergency does occur,

you’ll be prepared.</p>
<p>Note that this does <em>not</em> create a watch only wallet. Instead,

because you’re using your seed phrase, it’s recreating the private key.

That means that this wallet will have full signing and spending

ability.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open up Blue Wallet. In the top right is a plus sign, to add a

new wallet. <strong>Click on the plus sign</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Add Wallet screen, under Type, make sure to stick with the

default of Bitcoin (not Multisig Vault).</p></li>
<li><p>Do <em>not</em> click on Create, which is the default. (That

creates a brand new wallet.) Instead, click on <strong>Import</strong>.

This will give you the opportunity to enter the seed phrase.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the 12 seed phrase for the Bob wallet in the free form

field. Make sure to enter them in the right order, with the correct

spelling, and a space between each word. Click

<strong>Import</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The transactions will show up soon, if everything was entered

correctly.<br/>

You may need to close and reopen Blue Wallet, to make the transactions

appear.</p></li>
<li><p>The default name for an imported wallet starts with “Imported”.

Click on the three dots at the top right, and rename the wallet

<strong>Bob Recovery</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Did you get a message “No wallets were found”? This usually means

that you typed in the seed phrase incorrectly. Check the words very

carefully, make sure the spelling is exact, and that there’s a space

between each word.</p>
<p><strong>Checking the recovered wallet</strong>: To double-check that

the recovered wallet was set up correctly, do two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Review transactions</strong>: You should be able to see

the same transactions in the Bob Recovery wallet in Blue Wallet as you

do in the original Bob wallet in Sparrow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Addresses</strong>: Assuming you see the

transactions, everything should be good. But in general (and especially

if the original wallet has no transactions) you want to review addresses

between the original and a recovered wallet.<br/>

In the Bob wallet in Sparrow, click on the blue Addresses button to see

the addresses. In the Bob Recovery wallet in Blue Wallet, click on the

three dots at the top right. At the very bottom of the dropdown, there’s

a <strong>Show Addresses</strong> option. Compare a few of them with the

Sparrow addresses. They should be the same. (Blue Wallet makes it

difficult to review the addresses that are already used, so just look at

the unused ones.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-the-private-key-is-portable-between-wallet-applications.">Learn

more: the private key is portable between wallet applications. </h3>
<p>As you know by now, you see identical transactions in Blue Wallet and

Sparrow because you used either the public key (for a watch only wallet)

or the seed phrase (to recover a wallet).</p>
<p>For the recovered wallet, you entered the seed phrase that was

generated for the first Bob wallet. That seed phrase translates to the

same private key, and that private key is linked to the same addresses

(assuming the script type, etc., is set up correctly).</p>
<p>When Blue Wallet looks up the addresses in the blockchain, it finds

the same transactions as Sparrow did, looking up those same addresses in

the blockchain.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is that you don’t need any

<em>specific</em> software. As long as you hold your own private key

(which is the whole point of self custody), nobody can prevent you from

switching to a different bitcoin software wallet. For instance, if you

didn’t like Sparrow, you might decide to work with Blue Wallet.</p>
<p>Compare this to traditional banking. Switching banks requires a

lengthy process—transferring funds, closing your old account, submitting

ID documents to open a new one, and waiting for approvals. You need

permission from financial institutions and government agencies at every

step.</p>
<p>Or, consider people living in countries where it’s difficult or

impossible to get a bank account. They are often forced to use actual

paper currency, which is always losing value, sometimes rapidly. So,

they’re completely unable to save money for their future.</p>
<p>Bitcoin can be a lifeline in these situations, if you know how to use

it. Nobody can prevent you from saving, sending, or receiving

bitcoin.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-26-send-all-bitcoin-from-the-bob-recovery-wallet-in-blue-wallet-to-alice-in-sparrow">Exercise

26: Send all bitcoin from the Bob Recovery wallet in Blue Wallet to

Alice in Sparrow</h1>
<p>Once you’ve created your recovery wallet, what’s the next step?</p>
<p>Your next step would be to test it, to make sure you can actually

spend from it. After all, that’s the moment of truth—if everything was

done correctly, you can send bitcoin from your recovery wallet.</p>
<p>So in this exercise, you will send bitcoin from the Bob Recovery

wallet (in Blue Wallet) to the Alice wallet, in Sparrow.</p>
<p>You’ll send <em>all</em> the bitcoin in this step, because we’re

nearing the end of the book, and you don’t necessarily want to have

bitcoin scattered across different wallets.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open Sparrow. Open the Alice wallet, and click the blue

<strong>Receive</strong> button on the left, to bring up a receive

address. You’ll be using the QR code, to transfer the receive address to

Blue Wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>In Blue Wallet, open the Bob Recovery wallet. At the bottom of

the screen, click <strong>Send</strong>. On the Send screen, click

<strong>Scan</strong> to the right of the address, to bring up the

camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Blue Wallet on your phone to scan the receive address in

Sparrow. It should populate the address field, to the left of the Scan

button.</p></li>
<li><p>In Blue Wallet on your phone, instead of entering the amount of

sats to send, click on the three dots at the top right corner. Then

click on the option <strong>Use Full Balance</strong>. Blue Wallet will

ask you to confirm.</p></li>
<li><p>The default fee in Blue Wallet is set to get your transaction

into the next block. You can click on it, to adjust the fee. I lowered

mine to 2 sats/vB, because fees were low in general, and I thought it

would still go through quickly enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter in the Note to Self field: “<strong>send to Alice in

Sparrow</strong>”, and click <strong>Next.</strong> On the next screen,

click <strong>Send now</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After you hit Send now, you’ll see that in Blue Wallet, in the main

screen, you have a pending transaction. It shows with the amount you

sent, plus the fee, and starts out as Pending, because it hasn’t yet

been confirmed.</p>
<p>Whenever the transaction gets confirmed, you’ll see the “Pending”

disappear in Blue Wallet. Also, it will now show up with a confirmation

in the Alice wallet in Sparrow.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="learn-more-recovery-after-a-potential-seed-phrase-theft">Learn more:

recovery after a potential seed phrase theft</h3>
<p>What would you need to do in a real emergency recovery? For instance,

in a situation where your laptop has been stolen, and you had Sparrow

set up on that laptop, with a “hot” software wallet on it?</p>
<p>If the thief understood bitcoin, and knew you had Sparrow installed

with a software wallet, you might be out of luck. The thief would

probably have instantly sent all the bitcoin from your wallet to a

different wallet, one that he controls.</p>
<p>In case the thief didn’t know these details, you may have more time.

However, you still need to move your bitcoin. You need to send the

entire amount from your old wallet, with the old seed phrase, to a new

wallet with a new seed phrase. Moving all the funds from one bitcoin

wallet to another is called “sweeping”.</p>
<p>Note that if you do this, you will lose all the labels for your

transactions and addresses, because they’re saved in the Sparrow wallet

file, not on the blockchain. This can be a serious issue, because

knowing where your sats came from (through the labels) can be important

for privacy. If you’d like to learn more, read up on the topic of “coin

control in bitcoin”.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-27-bonususe-blockstream-wallet">Exercise 27: Bonus—use

Blockstream wallet</h1>
<p>In these exercises, the bitcoin wallet software we’ve been using has

been mostly Sparrow. You also did a few exercises with Blue Wallet.</p>
<p>You used multiple wallets because by doing tasks like recovering seed

phrases, setting up watch only wallets, and sending bitcoin

<em>across</em> different wallets, you end up with a better

understanding of the fundamentals of bitcoin.</p>
<p>When you do this, you learn about seed phrases and what they truly

represent, the blockchain and transaction fees, and privacy and security

for your bitcoin—all at a deeper level.</p>
<p>In this bonus exercise, you’ll install another bitcoin wallet

application—Blockstream. Like Sparrow and Blue Wallet, it’s also open

source. Here, instead of splitting out all the different tasks into

different exercises, I’ll give you a list of the tasks, and you’ll

figure out how to do it. You have done similar tasks in Sparrow and Blue

Wallet, so you’ve got a good background.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll set up your final separate wallet, with a

new seed phrase. This wallet represents another bitcoin user, Dan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Install Blockstream from the Blockstream site: <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://blockstream.com/app</a>.

There are versions both for desktop and mobile.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new wallet with Blockstream. Instead of the term

<em>seed phrase</em>, Blockstream uses <em>recovery phrase</em>. A

6-digit PIN is required. Create the wallet Dan, a standard single sig

wallet, and use the defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>To get some sats into Dan, do a send from the Carol wallet on

Blue Wallet, to Dan on Blockstream. You can completely empty the Carol

wallet with this send. That way, you don’t need to worry about having

leftover sats in Carol.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your Alice seed phrase to recover your Alice wallet in

Blockstream. The default settings should be correct, and you should see

all your transactions if you recovered the seed phrase

correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>As your last step with Dan—send <em>all</em> the bitcoin in Dan

(on Blockstream), to Alice. You can get the receive address for Alice

either via the recovered wallet in Blockstream, or directly from the

Alice wallet, in Sparrow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So now you’ve had extensive experience in three bitcoin wallet

applications—Sparrow, Blue Wallet, and Blockstream. Sparrow can be

fairly straightforward, and gives you access to many tools and options.

Blue Wallet is very simple, with limited options, but its simplicity

makes it easy to use. And Blockstream is somewhere in between the

two.</p>
<p>This hands-on experience with multiple different bitcoin wallets

gives you a more comprehensive understanding of bitcoin, and also the

flexibility to adapt to different tools. You’ve become a much more

informed user.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-28-clearing-practice-wallets-and-creating-a-long-term-wallet">Exercise

28: Clearing practice wallets and creating a long-term wallet</h1>
<p>If you’ve followed all the steps in the exercises, all wallets should

be cleared out and empty, <em>except</em> for the Alice wallet. That’s

the only one that should contain bitcoin.</p>
<p>If this isn’t the case, go ahead now and do that. You don’t want to

have bitcoin sitting around in multiple wallets, unless you have a

specific purpose in mind. If you always want a place to experiment and

practice with bitcoin transactions, you could leave a small amount of

bitcoin in the Alice wallet. Otherwise, you can transfer it to a new

wallet.</p>
<p>You’ll probably want to create a “real” wallet now, a long-term one,

and one that may potentially hold a substantial amount of bitcoin. Go

ahead and do that, using what you’ve learned. Below are some best

practices to consider.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="keeping-your-seed-phrase-safe">Keeping

your seed phrase safe</h3>
<p>The guidelines that you follow when working with this new wallet will

be different—you’ll need to think more about privacy and security.</p>
<p>The wallet you’ll be creating—unlike the ones you just used in the

exercises—is <em>not</em> a short-term wallet for learning purposes. So,

treat the seed phrase more carefully. Here are some of the ways to keep

your seed phrase secure and private:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Never tell anyone your seed phrase. Anyone who asks for it is a

scammer.</p></li>
<li><p>Never take a photo of your seed phrase. Don’t create or use a

seed phrase anywhere with any cameras (webcams, security cameras,

doorbell cameras, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Never type your seed phrase online. There are numerous websites

that will ask you to type in your seed phrase to “check” it. These are

run by scammers, they will immediately steal your bitcoin.</p></li>
<li><p>Never send your seed phrase via text or email.</p></li>
<li><p>Never speak your seed phrase out loud, especially where there are

listening devices (like Alexa devices, phones, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a backup of your seed phrase in a safe place. Consider

having multiple backups in different locations. Also think longer

term—what if a flood or fire damages your home? Some people write their

seed phrase on metal plates.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t talk about how much bitcoin you own. That information is

best kept private.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that making your bitcoin security <em>too</em> complex

can also be a problem. Apparently a large amount of bitcoin has been

lost through over-complicated security schemes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="Header-1-without-numbers" id="final-notes-and-next-steps">Final notes and next steps</h1>
<p>Completing the exercises in this book is a major milestone. You have

a rock-solid understanding of the mechanics of bitcoin private keys and

transactions. You’ve practiced with them in many different ways. This

familiarity is important. It lessens the fear that most people have, of

making some kind of mistake and losing bitcoin.</p>
<p>The confidence that develops through following the exercises and

gradually understanding the concepts—that confidence is critical. The

most important thing it allows you to do is <em>take action,</em> and

avoid the “analysis paralysis” caused by fear.</p>
<p>So, congratulations! And let’s talk about some of the next topics

you’ll be interested in learning more about.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="security-and-privacy">Security and

privacy</h3>
<p>At the beginning, when you were working with small, temporary

wallets, you didn’t need to worry very much about security. The amounts

were small, and the wallet was temporary.</p>
<p>Now you need to think about security differently. The realization

should have become crystal clear—your seed phrase, and the private key

it represents, is the key to your bitcoin. So if anyone with bad

intentions were to find it, they could very easily steal your bitcoin.

They would do this in the exact same way that you moved bitcoin around,

in the exercises.</p>
<p>Also, the Alice and Bob wallet have been opened in multiple different

tools—Sparrow, Blue Wallet, Blockstream. As practice exercises, it’s

good to work with multiple wallets, to develop skills and a better

understanding of transactions.</p>
<p>But for a wallet that contains larger amounts of bitcoin, and that

will be a long-term holding wallet, you want to expose it as little as

possible. It’s like telling a secret to three trustworthy friends. Sure,

they’re trustworthy, but it would be far more private and secure to not

tell the secret to anyone.</p>
<p>Privacy and security go together like hand and glove. If you’re

private about your bitcoin holdings, then your security is far, far

better. Most of the physical attacks related to bitcoin have been on

people who have somehow been in the public eye because of bitcoin.</p>
<p>Talk about bitcoin, if you want. But never tell people how much you

own, and don’t post anything online or on social media about how much

you own.</p>
<p>Privacy is very important. For instance, in Sweden there are laws

that put all tax records in the public domain, including names and

addresses. Criminals have searched those records, and then linked them

to social media mentions of bitcoin. Those searches provided the

criminals with good targets, and there have been multiple attacks on

bitcoiners in Sweden. (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swedish-bitcoiners-targeted-by-armed-criminals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cointelegraph.com/news/swedish-bitcoiners-targeted-by-armed-criminals</a>,

retrieved 2/6/2025)</p>
<p>Remember: good security habits are built over time. Don’t rush into

complex setups before mastering the basics. Your security approach

should evolve over time, just like your knowledge and assets in

bitcoin.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="threat-model">Threat model</h3>
<p>Of course, when you self custody your own bitcoin, you are immune to

<em>the</em> most common threat to your bitcoin, which is when the

exchange that you hold your bitcoin on is hacked, or if the exchange

itself has stolen the funds. Another major threat if you don’t self

custody is that the government can force the exchange to hand over all

the bitcoin that it holds—bitcoin that you thought was yours.</p>
<p>But assuming your bitcoin is in self custody, you want to consider

the concept of “threat model”. For instance—in your particular

situation, what is the most likely threat to your bitcoin stash? Then,

based on that, you make decisions about how to best protect it.</p>
<p>Let’s consider some of the most commonly recognized threats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Losing your seed phrase</p></li>
<li><p>Fire, flood, or other disaster destroying your seed phrase

backup</p></li>
<li><p>Robbery and physical coercion, to reveal your seed

phrase</p></li>
<li><p>Malware on your computer that captures your keystrokes, and

watches for anything like a seed phrase</p></li>
<li><p>A scammer convinced you to reveal your seed phrase</p></li>
<li><p>User error, making a mistake because your security setup is too

complex. For instance, adding a passphrase to the seed phrase, and

forgetting the passphrase</p></li>
<li><p>You die, and your heirs don’t know how to access your

bitcoin</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are situations you need to consider, and guard against.</p>
<p>Or let’s say you’re a refugee, escaping a war. You have managed to

scrape together some bitcoin, and need to cross multiple borders with

it. What’s your main concern, in this situation? It’s to make sure that

you don’t have anything on you to indicate you might own bitcoin. No

hardware wallets, no software wallets on your phone, no suspicious

looking lists of 12 words as you pass through various immigration

checkpoints. In this case, you’d want to carefully memorize your seed

phrase, and then set up your wallet again when you’re settled in a safe

place.</p>
<p>If you live in an area where forest fires are common? In that

situation, you definitely need to have a backup of your seed phrase in a

different location, or maybe a multisig setup.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="if-you-have-a-lot-of-bitcoin-to-secure">If

you have a lot of bitcoin to secure</h3>
<p>You might be in a situation where need to secure a substantial amount

of bitcoin. In that case, there’s a whole separate set of strategies to

consider.</p>
<p>The maker of Sparrow Wallet, Craig Raw, has some suggestions about

what kind of security and privacy considerations you need to take, as

you put more of your assets into bitcoin. See what he has to say here:

<a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s some additional strategies to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Multiple backups</strong>: If you have just one backup of

your seed phrase, you’re vulnerable to losing access to your bitcoin.

Especially if you have larger amounts to worry about, you will want to

consider having another copy of your seed phrase, perhaps given in

encrypted format to a close friend or family. The danger, of course, is

that there’s another copy of your seed phrase out there.</p>
<p><strong>Multisig wallets</strong>: These are usually done as a 2 of 3

setup, in which there are 3 seed phrases, and 2 of them are needed to

sign a transaction and spend bitcoin. The seed phrases are usually

stored in different physical locations, so it would be much more

difficult for thieves to get access to 2 of them. The tradeoff is that

they’re more complex to set up and maintain.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Timelocks</strong>: Timelocks are a bitcoin security

feature that restrict spending until a certain condition is met, such as

when a specific time has passed. This is a mostly unexplored area, but I

predict that it’ll start becoming much more popular as more bitcoin

wallet software starts supporting it.</p>
<p><strong>Have a “cold storage” vault</strong>: If you have substantial

assets in bitcoin, consider having separate wallets for different

purposes. The “cold storage vault” gets the most security, of

course.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cold storage vault: You have the majority of your assets here.

It’s rarely accessed except to receive bitcoin, and it’s accessed via a

watch only wallet except in case of emergency. This would be like a

safe, with gold bars in it, kept very secure.</p></li>
<li><p>Spending account: This is where most transactions occur. This is

more like a checking account, or a debit card, or cash in your wallet.

Security isn’t as much of a concern. You may also choose to do smaller

transactions in the Lightning network (see the section on Lightning in

the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> chapter).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Run your own bitcoin node</strong>: If you have substantial

assets in bitcoin to protect, you should consider connecting to a

private bitcoin node that you control. When connecting to public bitcoin

nodes, which is the default in Sparrow, there’s the potential that

you’re exposing private information—not the seed phrase, but information

about what IP address is linked to a particular bitcoin address. And

often an IP address can be linked to a street address.</p>
<p>Another option if you can’t run a bitcoin node is to run a Tor proxy

in Sparrow, which also gives better privacy. You can find more info on

this topic online.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="hardware-wallets">Hardware wallets</h3>
<p><strong>What is a hardware wallet?</strong> A hardware wallet is a

small, specialized device that has one purpose only—to store the private

keys needed to access your bitcoin. When you want to send bitcoin, you

need to get the hardware wallet, and usually unlock it with a PIN. Then

your hardware wallet transmits the digital signature to the computer

where the bitcoin transaction is being managed. The transaction can be

set up with Sparrow, but usually the hardware wallet will have its own

software. The signature is usually sent via a USB cable, or sometimes

with QR codes.</p>
<p><strong>Do you need to buy a hardware wallet immediately?</strong>

Hardware wallet manufacturers would like you to buy one, of course. And

these manufacturers are very influential, and advertise heavily in

bitcoin podcasts and videos.</p>
<p>But my answer would be no, you don’t need to. Not until your stash of

bitcoin is more substantial, or unless you have special requirements.

It’s okay to begin with a hot wallet on Sparrow or Blue Wallet, assuming

the laptop or phone is properly secured.</p>
<p>Think of it this way—you need to consider the security and privacy of

your bitcoin in a step-by-step approach. You wouldn’t purchase an

expensive safe if you only have a small piece of silver to secure,

right? You would purchase that safe only if you have a gold bar that you

want to secure—something much more valuable. The same principle applies

with holding a smaller amount of bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong>There’s some negatives to hardware wallets as well.</strong>

Hardware wallets can offer some protection for bitcoin storage when

everything works well, but they aren’t the perfect solution. Yes, they

can protect private keys from malware. At the same time, they also

introduce their own risks, like closed-source software, and mandatory

firmware updates.</p>
<p>And hardware wallets remain completely out of reach for many people

in poorer countries, because of cost, availability, and import barriers.

It’s almost impossible to find any hardware wallet for less than about

$75.</p>
<p>But maybe the most important factor is that once you’ve purchased a

hardware wallet, you’re advertising to the world that you probably own

bitcoin. And there have been <em>major</em> data leaks. In 2020, the

largest hardware wallet company, Ledger, was hacked and the entire

customer database, including name, address, and order details, was

published. These types of issues happen over and over, and make people

very nervous.</p>
<p>The standard advice is to not have hardware wallets shipped to your

home address, only to a post office box. But that option introduces

extra expense, complications, and delay.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> So, I don’t necessarily recommend

hardware wallets to beginners, when they first start their bitcoin

journey. Until you accumulate an amount of bitcoin that would cause

serious pain if you lost it, consider this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A hot wallet in Sparrow, with a password on the wallet file. Or a

hot wallet on a phone, also with a password.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your computer or phone is well secured.</p></li>
<li><p>Back up your seed phrase well, potentially in multiple

locations</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then as you learn more about bitcoin and security and accumulate

more, you may decide that you should get a hardware wallet, and store

your seed phrase on the hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Make sure the one you buy is bitcoin only, and doesn’t use

proprietary software (in other words, it should be open source). Below

are some of the most well-known options.</p>

<p>The SeedSigner is a hardware wallet that you can put together

yourself, with a Raspberry PI and a few other components. You can also

purchase a fully assembled one on the SeedSigner website.</p>
<p>Some people have also gone the DIY approach, by using TailsOS on a

USB stick, or similar options. Here’s a post that has more information

on that method: <a href="https://stacker.news/items/569901" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stacker.news/items/569901</a>.

Make sure you do some research before you choose this option.</p>
<p>I suggest that you continue to use Sparrow to manage and coordinate

transactions—it’s more secure than the software provided by the hardware

wallet vendor. Also, you now have a very good understanding of Sparrow,

after going through these exercises.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="keep-on-learning">Keep on learning</h3>
<p>As you’ve learned throughout this book, the basics of Bitcoin are

straightforward. There are many details that can make the process of

dealing with wallets, and sending and receiving bitcoin challenging. But

think of this: you now know more about the practical use of bitcoin than

the vast majority of the world’s population. The skills you’ve

developed, in working with this revolutionary monetary technology, are

ones that most people haven’t begun to grasp. These skills allow you to

take control of your financial future as a sovereign individual.</p>
<p>There’s a popular phrase in Bitcoin, about “<em>going down the rabbit

hole</em>”. Most bitcoiners have, at one point or another, become

obsessive about learning as much as possible about Bitcoin (the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section in this book is a good place to

start). They spend hundreds of hours, reading books and articles,

listening to podcasts and videos, and talking to other bitcoiners both

in person and online. And one topic leads to another—it’s really an

endlessly fascinating journey.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of your journey. As you grow more

comfortable with Bitcoin’s concepts and tools, you’ll discover new ideas

and tools. Start small, experiment often, and build on each success.

Many people began learning about Bitcoin with only NGU in mind (a

bitcoin term “<em>Number Go Up</em>”, in other words, just a raw desire

to make money). Then later, they find themselves going deeper and deeper

into Bitcoin’s fascinating economic and technical layers.</p>
<p>Take your time, stay curious, and keep learning—the rabbit hole goes

as deep as you dare to explore. I’ll leave you with a favorite saying of

bitcoiners everywhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fix the money, fix the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Bitcoin’s promise: an alternative to broken money and theft

via inflation. By reclaiming control of your wealth through

self-custody, you’re not just protecting your future—you’re opting out

of a broken system. Bitcoin restores money as a tool of freedom, not

force.</p>
<p>The revolution starts in your wallet.</p>

<p><strong>The Bullish Case for Bitcoin by Vijay Boyapati</strong></p>
<p>Many people have been introduced to the “why” of bitcoin through one

article published on Medium: <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The

Bullish Case for Bitcoin</a>. It’s an inspiring introduction to Bitcoin,

including a review of money throughout history. Boyapati writes a primer

on the value of Bitcoin, and why it’s superior to government currency,

and even gold. He’s also expanded the article into an entire book, which

is also a good read.</p>
<p><strong>The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous</strong></p>
<p>This classic book is the one that everyone even remotely interested

in Bitcoin should read. Ammous goes into great depth on what makes a

good money, and why. He writes about the best monies throughout history,

and how when one type of money replaces another, those who hold on to

the old form of money are impoverished.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin University YouTube channel</strong></p>
<p>One of the YouTube channels that I recommend for learning about

Bitcoin is Bitcoin University (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University</a>).

The creator, Matthew Kratter has solid information on self custody as

well as many other aspects of Bitcoin.<br/>

A reminder—with YouTube channels, the comments section will often have

scammers, so be cautious.</p>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="the-lightning-network">The Lightning

Network</h3>
<p>Bitcoin’s blockchain is secure and reliable, but it can be

inconvenient and expensive for small transactions. This is especially a

problem when the transaction fees are high. To solve this, developers

have created what’s called “Layer-2” solutions. These work on top of the

Bitcoin network, to make transactions faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>The most popular layer 2 is the Lightning Network. The Lightning

Network lets users open payment channels, to send bitcoin instantly with

very low fees. Instead of recording every transaction on the blockchain,

lightning handles them off-chain, and only settles the final result on

the bitcoin blockchain. This makes it perfect for small

transactions.</p>
<p>If you’re using lightning regularly, be aware that it evolves

quickly, and wallet apps sometimes disappear. In the United States, some

of the most popular lightning wallets have been removed from app stores

because of financial regulations. So, it’s important to stay informed,

and avoid keeping large amounts in your lightning wallet.</p>
<p>Lightning wallet apps fall into two categories—custodial and

non-custodial.</p>
<p><strong>Custodial Lightning</strong></p>
<p>The custodial ones take custody of your bitcoin on the app, and don’t

allow you to manage it directly. But they also don’t require you to know

the details of payment channels and nodes, which can be very

challenging. These types of app charge a small fee for sending

transactions. Also, since it’s not self custody, it’s best to avoid

storing larger amounts on them.</p>
<p>Some of the more popular ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CoinOS (<a href="https://coinos.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://coinos.io/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Aqua (<a href="https://aquawallet.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://aquawallet.io/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Wallet of Satoshi (<a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/</a>,

not available in the US).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you purchased your bitcoin with the Strike app, you already have a

lightning wallet built into it. However, it’s KYC, and thus tied to your

identity.</p>
<p><strong>Non-custodial Lightning</strong></p>
<p>The non-custodial apps do not take charge of your bitcoin, instead

you work with your own bitcoin on the app. They require you to

understand and manage your own lightning channels and nodes. You still

pay a fee, but it’s lower and you have much more control over fees.

Lightning is a fascinating area to learn about, but self custody with

lightning is challenging for beginners. So, I’d recommend lots of

research before setting up a lightning channel. Some of the more popular

non-custodial apps are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Zeus (<a href="https://zeusln.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://zeusln.com/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Breez (<a href="https://breez.technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://breez.technology/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Phoenix (<a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://phoenix.acinq.co/</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="NewSubheading" id="support">Support</h3>
<p>If you need more support for any of the tools you’ve worked with, a

good place to go is the sites recommended on the official website. Often

these are hosted on Telegram.</p>
<p>For instance, if you need help with Sparrow, go to the official

Sparrow website (<a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sparrowwallet.com/</a>), and

look for the Telegram link, right above the Download button. The

hardware wallet SeedSigner also has a link to their Telegram group on

the FAQ page.</p>
<p>One thing to note about any public bitcoin group, especially in

Telegram, is that they are <em>very</em> heavily targeted by scammers.

If you ever post on one of these, you’ll immediately get multiple people

sending you private messages. They’re all from scammers, so never

respond to any private messages. Everything that’s legitimate is in

public chat on these groups. And of course, never give anyone your seed

phrase.</p>
<p>Never search for bitcoin related telegram groups by searching

directly in Telegram. There are many groups out there that have official

sounding names, but are actually run by scammers.</p>
<p>For instance, there’s a Telegram group called Sparrow Technical

Support, run by scammers. If you post there, the administrators will try

to get you to reveal your seed phrase. When looking for a support group

on Telegram, only go to the Telegram group link from the official

website.</p>
