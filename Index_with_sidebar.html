<p class="Header1withoutnumbers"><a name="_Toc202777437"><span lang="EN">Introduction</span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">First of all, thank you for purchasing this
book! Any feedback would be appreciated. For any questions or issues, please
send email to </span><a href="feedback@BitcoinHandsOn.com"><span lang="EN">feedback@BitcoinHandsOn.com</span></a><span lang="EN">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Ill start out by telling you what this book
is not. Its not about the why of Bitcoin. Im going to assume that since youre
reading this book, youre convinced that Bitcoin has a lot of promise, and you
believe that learning how to use Bitcoin directly, without intermediaries, is important.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Its also not about the history of money, why
government currencies (also known as fiat currencies) seem to inevitably fail,
how inflation is actually theft, or similar topics. There are writers much
smarter than I am who have gone over these topics, in depth. I list some of the
best books in the </span><a href="#Resources"><span lang="EN">Resources</span></a><span lang="EN"> section. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Instead, this book is all about actually using
Bitcoin. Its about using software to create wallets that you control directlyin
other words, self custody. Its about understanding, at a very practical level,
what a private key is and why its important. Its about learning to manage
your wallets, and sending and receiving sats (short for satoshis, 1 bitcoin
equals 100 million sats) without needing to go through gatekeepers like banks
or investment firms. Learning how to use Bitcoin may be the most important technical
skill you ever develop.</span></p>
<h3>Why is self custody important?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Holding your own bitcoinself custodyis key
to getting the benefit of Bitcoin, over the long run. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">If you already own bitcoin, is it in self
custody? Well, if you dont have the private keythe private key that you could
use to send and receive the bitcoin directlythen its not in self custody. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Lets look at some cases where people think
they own bitcoin, but they dont actually control it:</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">If youre holding bitcoin on an ETF (exchange
traded fund), then you dont have bitcoin in self custody, its all managed by
the fund. Its not possible to withdraw actual bitcoin from the exchange.
Instead, you need to sell the bitcoin and withdraw USD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">If youre holding bitcoin on an exchange, such as
Coinbase or Kraken, then you still dont have bitcoin in self custody. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">An exchange is an improvement over an ETF,
because usually you can withdraw the bitcoin into a self custody wallet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But still, many exchanges have failedthrough hacks or
fraudsince Bitcoins creation<span lang="EN">. Early bitcoiners learned through
bitter experience that they shouldnt trust exchanges. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The history of Bitcoin exchanges is full of these
scams and thefts, ranging from one of the earliest and most famous (Mt. Gox in
2014) to more recent scams (FTX and Celsius in 2022). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Theres one thing these disasters had in
common. Its that the supposed owners of the bitcoin did <i>not</i> actually
hold their own keys. Instead, they left their bitcoin in the custody of others,
in what are called custodial wallets. People thought it was safer to have
their bitcoin in the custody of large firms, instead of managing it themselves.
They were wrong.</span></p>
<p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Not your keys, not your coins</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">If you didnt understand <i>Not your keys,
not your coins</i>, you wouldnt have necessarily known that you were doing
something dangerous, by relying on other people to manage your bitcoin. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">For instance, take one of the more recent exchange
failures, FTX. Mainstream media news coverage of FTX was glowing. It stayed
positive until just before the whole thing unraveled, and was revealed as a
huge scam. </span>Most users didnt realize they were taking a serious risk by
leaving their bitcoin on the platform.</p>
<h3>Its not as hard as it seems</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">For many people, self custodyusing bitcoin
directly and holding the private key themselvesis intimidating. Without an
intermediary like a bitcoin exchange or ETF, people worry about making mistakes
and losing their hard-earned money. Many people avoid self custody because they
dont understand seed phrases and private keys.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Bitcoin can seem mystifying and complex. It
may seem that using Bitcoin requires an understanding of the underlying
technology, and in-depth knowledge of cryptography. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">But thats absolutely not true. Im here to
tell you that you do <i>not</i> need this in-depth knowledge. Do you need to
understand how a car engine works, in order to drive? No, you dont. You also
dont need to understand every technical detail about how Bitcoin works, in
order to safely use it. </span></p>
<h3>Taking small steps in a safe environment</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The learn-by-doing exercises in this book will
walk you through the process of learning Bitcoin, one simple step at a time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">When youre learning to drive a car, do you
immediately start driving on the highway? No, you dont. You head to a large
parking lot, and practice driving there. You make a lot of left turns and right
turns, starts and stops. Thats what youll be doing in Bitcoin, Hands-Onlots
of practice, in a low-risk environment. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Working your way through </span>this book<b> </b>will
help you overcome the anxiety that can come with managing your own bitcoin. The
exercises use a few temporary, small test wallets, that you create and control.
This is the Bitcoin equivalent of taking your first drive in a parking lot, to
learn about the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brake. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With these small wallets, youll make steady progress
through the exercises with small amounts, gaining confidence and learning to
avoid the problems that can occur. You master the skills you need to safely
send, receive, and store bitcoin. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc185499967">How to get the most out of this book</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Heres a few tips on going through the
exercises, and how to really learn the practical aspects of Bitcoinin a way
that sticks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">Name the wallets exactly as shown in the
instructions. This makes it easier to follow along, because the same wallets
are used throughout the whole book.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">Complete all the exercises, even if you think you
know whats going to happen. Actually doing the steps is key to learning. Just
reading isnt enough.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">Consider doing each exercise twice. First, follow
along step by step with the book. Then, try it again without the
instructionsjust from memory and the name of the exercise. Thats where the real
learning happens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">Transaction fees now (early 2025) are quite low. But
if youre concerned about fees, the lowest fees are usually on weekend
mornings, US east coast time (EST). So, consider doing the exercises that
involve transactions during that time. Youll learn more in exercises 17 and 18
about fees.</span></p>
<h3>Authors note on Bitcoin capitalization: </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Standards are still evolving on when Bitcoin
should be capitalized, but the consensus seems to beupper case when speaking
of Bitcoin as a system, and lower case when speaking of the currency units, or
as an adjective. Thats what I do in this book.</span></p>

<h1><a name="_Toc202777438"><span lang="EN">Exercise 1: Install Sparrow Bitcoin
Wallet</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In this step well install Sparrow Bitcoin
Wallet. Sparrow is the most widely used and respected desktop Bitcoin wallet.
Its freeand more importantly, its open source. Open source software means
that the code is publicly available for review. You can see the actual Sparrow
Wallet source code right here: </span><a href="https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow"><span lang="EN" style="color:
windowtext">https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow</span></a><span lang="EN">. This
allows people to verify theres nothing harmful hidden in the software.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Sparrow Wallet is suitable for beginners, but
has all the functionality expert users need as well. So, its a great tool to
use on your Bitcoin learning path. The Sparrow version that I used is 2.2.2. However,
its frequently updated, and your version might be different. If any changes significantly
impact these exercises, I will update them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">To install Sparrow, go to </span><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/"><span lang="EN" style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/download/</span></a><span lang="EN">. Youll see options for downloading versions for MacOS, Windows, and
Linux. Download and install whichever version matches your operating system.
The instructions for the install will be different for each operating system.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">If youre using Windows, theres an Installer
version and a Standalone version. Download the Installer version unless you
have a specific reason to use the Standalone version. During the install, leave
all the settings at the default. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The instructions in the exercises will be with
the Windows version of Sparrow, but it should be very similar in the MacOS and
Linux versions.</span></p>
<h3>I get a warning Windows protected your PC when I try to install</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">If youre running Windows, there are filters
turned on to protect you against unsafe software. But this filter can also be
triggered by software thats less common, like Sparrow. As long as youve
downloaded Sparrow from the above link, youre fine. In the warning window, click
More info and then Run anyway to continue with the installation. </span></p>
<h3>In the Edge Browser, the Sparrow download has an orange warning triangle</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When using the Windows Edge Browser, a message comes up
saying that the file isnt commonly downloaded, and make sure you trust it
before opening it. Click on the 3 dots to the right of this message, click Show
more, and then Keep Anyway.</p>
<h3>Is it hard to see the full screen in Sparrow, or is the text too small?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Sparrow is written in Java, to make it easier
to run on different operating systems. However, one disadvantage is that it can
cause screen resolution problems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">For me, with my resolution, I just live with
it because its not too bad. But you can also change the resolution by clicking
on the Windows Start button, typing Resolution, and then choosing the option Change
the resolution of the display.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Then under Scale and Layout, click the
dropdown under Change the size of text, apps, and other items, I experimented
with reducing my resolution. On your computer you may need to reduce or
increase the resolution. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Heres some information from the developers of
Sparrow on the problem:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#im-running-on-a-high-resolution-screen-and-sparrow-icons-and-text-are-tiny"><span lang="EN" style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#im-running-on-a-high-resolution-screen-and-sparrow-icons-and-text-are-tiny</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#sparrow-is-too-big-for-my-screen"><span lang="EN" style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/faq.html#sparrow-is-too-big-for-my-screen</span></a></p>
<h3>What server to connect to?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">When you install Sparrow, youll get some
options about choosing a server. This server is what Sparrow uses to point to
the Bitcoin network. For now, well stick to the default of using a public
server, mempool.space.</span></p>
<h3>Troubleshooting your connection in Sparrow</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Occasionally, you may notice that you cant click the
Broadcast Transaction button to send a transaction, or that youre not seeing
the latest transaction in a wallet. If the slider at the very bottom right
corner in Sparrow is gray, you have lost your connection. This can happen
sometimes, especially after restarting or switching wifi networks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To fix this, click on the slider to reconnect, or click <b><span lang="EN">File &gt; Preferences &gt; Server</span></b>, to edit and test your

<h3>Some warnings </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">There are websites and applications out there
that pretend to be the real thing, but are not. For instance, the real site for
Sparrow is </span><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com"><span lang="EN" style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com</span></a><span lang="EN">. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Unfortunately, a scam website
(sparrowwallet.net) sometimes comes up when you search for Sparrow Bitcoin
Wallet. But the software on that website is designed to steal your bitcoin. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">So, always be careful of any bitcoin related
software that you install. Check multiple sources to make sure youre
downloading from the right website. </span></p>
<h3>Extra Credit: verify the software</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">When using open source softwareespecially
bitcoin softwarethe extra step of verifying the software is recommended. Verification
is a step that confirms that the software is actually what its supposed to be.
It validates that theres no extra code snuck in, that could somehow compromise
your bitcoin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Verifying, and knowing for yourself, is one of
the core principles of Bitcoin. Its embodied in the saying popular with
bitcoiners: Dont trust, verify. And its also easier, with Bitcoin. All the
core software is open source, and you can review it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Dont trust, verify</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">To verify the Sparrow code, go to this page: </span><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/"><span lang="EN" style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/download/.</span></a>

<h3>Learn more: seed phrases and private keys</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In this exercise, we asked Sparrow to generate
the Mnemonic Words. These words are also commonly called the recovery phrase,
backup phrase, or seed words. But the most common way to refer to these words
is seed phrase. Thats what Ill use in this book.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">This seed phrase represents a very large
number, thats more random and impossible to guess than we can comprehend. The
seed phrase is just an easy way for humans to remember and write down that
number, using a specific set of common words. This list is called the BIP39
word list. </span></p>

exercises. Youll pay transaction fees to move the bitcoin around to different
wallets, but otherwise the bitcoin is yours to keep. And youll learn more
about transaction fees as you go through the exercises. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">A reminder</span><b></b>when<b> </b>youre
buying bitcoin in this step, youre <i>not</i> buying it on an exchange traded
fund (ETF), because then you wouldnt be holding and managing your own bitcoin.
Instead, youre buying bitcoin that you can receive into your own wallet, in
self custody.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since theres so many different sources to buy bitcoin from,
I cant walk you through the process of setting up an account and buying
bitcoin, because it will be different everywhere. But Ill give you some
general thoughts about the best ways and sources to buy from. </p>

</span></span><span lang="EN">The wallets youre working with are temporary. Once
youve finished the exercises, youll send the bitcoin to another wallet.</span></p>
<h3>Where should you buy bitcoin? KYC or P2P</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two main ways of buying bitcoin, KYC (Know Your
Customer) and P2P (Peer To Peer). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>KYC</b> is what most people use, in countries where
exchanges are available. It means using a centralized exchange, which follows
government Know Your Customer laws. On a KYC exchange, you need to open an
account, linked to your government ID, to purchase bitcoin. You will need to go
through an identity verification process. This usually includes submitting
photos of government-issued ID, as well as facial scans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>P2P </b>means youre not going through a regular
exchange. Instead, youre buying from a peersomeone who owns bitcoin and wants
to sell it. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If youre lucky enough to have a friend or family member
whos willing to sell you a small amount of bitcoin, then the transaction can
be very simple. You hand the friend or family member some cash, and give them a
bitcoin address from your wallet. Then they send you the bitcoin (minus the
transaction fee).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But often, P2P trades will be done online, via one of the secure,
private services mentioned below. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the main benefits of buying P2P is increased privacy.
If youre buying peer to peer, the only other person that knows about the
purchase is the seller. However, if youre buying from a KYC exchange, your
personal information is available to both the exchange, and the government. And
considering how often companies have been hacked and their customer database
stolenits not just the government who could get your data. Criminal gangs
could get it as well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem for people just starting to buy bitcoin is that
for these P2P services, you need to already own at least a small amount of
bitcoin. This is because usually a bitcoin bond or escrow needs to be set up. </p>
<h3>KYC Exchanges</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If youve decided that for now, youll use a KYC exchange,
you have many options. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its important to purchase from a bitcoin-only exchange. An
exchange that is bitcoin-only will have fewer points of failure. And more
importantly, they wont try to sell you other, inferior cryptocurrencies, that
they make more commission on. Companies that sell anything other than bitcoin
(exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, Binance) are <i>not </i>recommended.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Theres a saying among bitcoiners that expresses a core
beliefthat Bitcoin stands alone, and is fundamentally superior to other
cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Bitcoin, not crypto.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heres some KYC exchanges that are Bitcoin-only. This is not
an exhaustive list, and this information can change quickly, so do your own
research. Also, the exchange should make it very clear that they will actually
allow you to withdraw your bitcoin, to your own wallet. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Robosats requires a Bitcoin Lightning wallet in order to use
it (see the <a href="#Resources"><span style="color:windowtext">Resources</span></a>
section at the end of this book for more information on Lightning), but its
one of the most popular and easiest P2P exchanges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the next exercise, you will need to have already
completed the purchase of bitcoin. It needs to be ready to send, from the
exchange to your own receive address.</p>
<div style="border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in">
<h1><a name="_Toc202777441"><span lang="EN">Exercise 4: </span></a><span lang="EN">Receive
bitcoin into your Alice wallet</span></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In this exercise, youll actually receive
bitcoin into your wallet. </span>The procedure will be a little different on
each exchange. Some exchanges may even require you to get approval for the
receive address. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But basically, it will involve steps similar to this:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Open up the website or app for your exchange (where you bought
the bitcoin), and navigate to where you can send bitcoin out of the exchange.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Enter a bitcoin address. (This will be a receive address that you
get from the Alice wallet).</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Decide how much you want to send. Its easier to think of bitcoin
amounts in terms of sats, because 1 bitcoin is now very expensive. (Sats is
short for <span lang="EN">Satoshis. One whole bitcoin equals 100 million sats.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Enter the amount of sats you want to send to the Alice receive
address. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Decide on the amount of fees youre willing to pay. Some
exchanges may offer free transaction fees.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Hit the send button, and wait for the bitcoin to arrive in your
wallet.</p>
<h3>Example: Using Strike to receive bitcoin</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are what the steps look like when sending bitcoin from
Strike, the KYC exchange that I mentioned above. Remember, the process in the
exchange that you use will be different. Using Strike (which is a mobile app on
your phone), its easiest to use QR codes to get the bitcoin receive address,
instead of copying and pasting the address.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In Sparrow, open up the Alice wallet file. Click on the blue <b>Receive</b>
button on the left. Your wallet has many, many receive addresses, and Sparrow
will show you the first available address.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Label the receive address. I wrote Receive from Strike in the label. <span lang="EN">When using the defaults in Sparrow, all bitcoin addresses start with
bc1. The QR code for the address, which Ill use in the next step, is to the
right of the address.<br/>
Dont skip the label! Some of the following exercises depend on having labels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In the Strike app, I click the Bitcoin icon at the bottom left. I scroll
to the Send screen, and click Bitcoin wallet. <br/>
Then I go back to Sparrow on my computer, where the Receive window is still open.
I use Strike on my phone to scan the Sparrow QR code for the receive address. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In Strike, I enter the amount of sats that I want to send (about half of
what I purchased). </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Next is the fee. I could either pay a larger fee, to have the
transaction go through in the next 10 minutes, a medium fee to send it in the
next hour, or zero, to have it go through in the next 24 hours. <br/>
I chose to pay the higher fee, and have it go through within about 10 minutes.
Other exchanges will have different options for fees. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>On the next screen I review the details (amount, receive address),
before clicking to confirm the transaction. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the exchange youre using is a desktop application, and
not a mobile app, youll need to copy and paste the bitcoin address, instead of
using a QR code.</p>
<h3>Monitoring the receive into Alice</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">You will now receive the bitcoin into your Alice
wallet, in Sparrow. No matter where the bitcoin originally came from, heres
what you should see as the transaction goes through. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">If youve chosen to pay a higher fee for a
quicker transaction, itll all happen within about 10 minutes. Otherwise it
will take longer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">The first step is that you get a pop-up notice in the top right corner,
in Sparrow. Itll have a message entitled New mempool transaction, and the
amount of the transaction. These Sparrow notifications disappear after a few
seconds.<br/>
That means your transaction is in the mempool. (See the below section </span>Learn
more: Mempool and Blockchain<span lang="EN"> for more info.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Once youve gotten the pop-up notice in your Alice wallet, click on the
blue <b>Transactions</b> button on the left. You should have one transaction in
there, from the transaction you just made. The transaction will show up in
light gray at first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Youll receive another pop-up notification in Sparrow when the first
confirmation occurs, which is usually in about 10 minutes. Six confirmations is
usually considered final, and then the transaction in Sparrow will switch from
light gray to black. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Notice that in the Transactions window, theres a US dollar amount in
there. For the dollar amount, the current bitcoin price is used. (To set up a
different default currency, go </span>to File &gt; Settings &gt; Currency.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Congratulations! You now truly own some
bitcoin, its on your own personal wallet, and you have the private key.</span></p>
<h3>Troubleshooting your connection in Sparrow</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">This was also mentioned in Exercise 1, but heres
a reminder, because it happens often. You may notice that a transaction
doesn't show up when it should. If this happens, check the slider at the very
bottom right corner in Sparrow. If it's gray, you have lost your connection.
This can happen sometimes, especially after restarting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">To fix this, click on the slider to reconnect.</span></p>
<h3>Learn more: <a name="_Toc185499974"></a><a name="_Toc185500219">Mempool and
blockchain</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The mempool is a holding area for bitcoin
transactions that have been submitted, but not yet added to a block. Its like
bitcoins waiting rooman area where transactions sit before being included in
a block. When you send bitcoin, your transaction joins others in the mempool,
waiting for bitcoin miners to pick them up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">After a miner picks them up and confirms them
in a new block, the block gets added to the bitcoin blockchain. This means that
the transaction has one confirmation. When another block gets added to the
blockchain, your transaction will have two confirmations. Once it has six
confirmations, most people consider that final settlement</span><span lang="EN">in other words, its almost impossible to reverse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">What is the blockchain? Its like a giant
public notebook, or ledger, of all the transactions that have ever occurred. By
looking at the blockchain, you can see exactly what the transactions were, the
amounts of the transactions, and the sending and receiving address.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">You pay a fee, called the transaction fee, for
having your transaction included in the next block, and added to the
blockchain. This can be higher or lower, depending on how much competition
there is for transaction space in the bitcoin blockchain. Transactions that
include higher fees usually get chosen first by the miners, and go into the
very next block. Lower-fee transactions wait longer. Well discuss fees in more
detail later. </span></p>
<h3><a name="_Hlk197015367">Learn more: bitcoin mining </a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Just now, in the section on Mempool and
blockchain, the term bitcoin miners came up. What is, actually, the process of
bitcoin mining? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Basically, bitcoin mining happens with a
decentralized network of special computers (miners), all around the world.
These miners are competing</span> to solve a mathematical problem, every 10
minutes. Whichever computer finds the solution first gets to mine the next
block of transactions, which means linking the new block to the previous one in
the blockchain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin mining takes special, expensive computers, and lots
of electricity. The reason that the miners do this work is that they earn
bitcoin in two different ways, each time they mine a block. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>First, theres a reward in bitcoin, for the computer that mines
that block. This reward is substantial. In 2025, each mined block earns 3.125
bitcoin.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Also, the successful miner gets to keep the transaction fees
associated with the block.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The reward in bitcoin for the successful miner
is straightforward, its just a set amount.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The transaction fees are more complex. Every
single transaction needs to pay a fee, to pay for the work of putting it in the
block.</span><span lang="EN"> </span>And transaction fees depend on how busy the
network is.<span lang="EN"> If many people are trying to make transactions, </span>fees
go up because theres more competition for a scarce resourcespace on the
bitcoin blockchain. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its similar to when a city is hosting the Olympics. Hotel
rooms will get much more expensive because theres only a set amount of them.
Similarly, you will have to pay more in transaction fees when the bitcoin
network is congested. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Luckily, its now (in 2025) a period of
relatively low fees, so the transactions youll be making in these exercises
will be relatively inexpensive. </span></p>

<h3>Learn more: addresses</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Bitcoin receive addresses are unique
identifiers (strings of letters and numbers) that bitcoin can be sent to, by
anyone. One private key has many different addresses. Addresses should never be
reused, because that makes your transactions much less private. </span></p>

blue Addresses button on the left. Notice that you dont have just one section
for addresses. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Instead, you have two sections for addresses,
the Receive and the Change addresses, and they both have multiple addresses.
And thats not alltheres essentially an unlimited number of addresses that
can be generated, via some complex math, by the extended private key, which is
represented by your seed phrase.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>receive address</b> in Bitcoin is an address thats
designed for incoming transactions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>change address</b>, on the other hand,<b> </b>is
specifically set up for when you send bitcoin, and then receive change back
from the transaction. Because of some of the internals of bitcoin, you almost
always send a larger amount than what you want to spend. It comes back as
change, to one of the change addresses in your wallet. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its like paying for a $1 pack of gum with a $100 bill, and

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">One of the most important benefits of bitcoin
is that no permission is needed, in order to make transactions. Bitcoin is
whats called a bearer asset. Whoever actually owns the bitcoin (in other
words, has the seed phrase/private key) can spend them, with no intermediaries like
government, banks or any other financial institution. In this way its similar
to cash or gold bars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Government currencies like the US dollaroften

are many ways that you could be blocked from accessing your own money. </span>For
example, during protests like the Canadian Truckers Protest, some protesters,
or those people who wanted to donate to protesters, found their bank accounts
frozen or restricted. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also, transactions between different countries are
frequently controlled. These types of regulations are called capital controls.
If theres a way for access to your money to be blocked, itll probably happen
at some point. <span lang="EN">Capital controls and events like the Canadian
Truckers Protest of 2022 have demonstrated that the only assets that <i>truly</i>
belong to you, are the ones that you control.</span></p>

impossible for someone to prevent you from accessing and spending your bitcoinassuming

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In this exercise, were going to get familiar
with a few of the items in the Settings window of the Alice wallet. We wont go
into all of these settings in depththis is just to get an overview of the
settings youre most likely to use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">In Sparrow, make sure you have the Alice wallet open. The first option
is <b>Policy Type</b>. With Policy Type you can choose between Single Signature
and Multi Signature. Single Signature is the most common and simplest, and
thats what well be using in this book. <br/>
Multi Signature is much more complex, and requires multiple different private
keys. Its for people with significant assets in bitcoin, who need more
security. <br/>
(Warning: If youre experimenting and switch to Multi Sig, itll look as though
you lost your seed. Just close and reopen the wallet, and it'll be fine)</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Next is <b>Script Type</b>. Native Segwit is what well be using now,
and thats the default in Sparrow and most bitcoin wallet software. But its useful
to know that using different or incorrect script types can cause problems. This
happens occasionally when trying to restore a wallet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">The <b>Descriptor</b> is a way of encoding information about your

Seed</b> button and easily see the seed phrase you wrote down earlier. <br/>
This isnt secure, of course, but since this is a low-risk wallet (both
temporary and containing only a small amount of bitcoin), you dont need to
worry about it now. Later on, youll want more security, and well review other
options. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">The <b>Label</b> is mostly a way of distinguishing between different
wallets. By default with this type of wallet, its set to BIP39, but you can
change it. Its used mostly with Multi Signature wallets. <br/>
The <b>Master Fingerprint</b> is similar to the Label, in that it uniquely
identifies the wallet. But Master Fingerprint is system generated, as opposed
to being something you can edit. </span></p>

Create watch only wallet based on Alice</span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In this exercise youll create a special kind
of wallet, a watch only wallet. Itll be based on the Alice wallet you created
earlier. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Why create a watch only wallet? The main
reason is to keep your seed phrasethat extremely important set of
wordssecure, private, and not exposed very often. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In a watch only wallet you can do many of the
tasks that you need to do in a wallet, like receive bitcoin, and monitor
transactions. The only thing you cant do is spend bitcoin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Its common to create a watch only wallet for
your main wallet. A watch only wallet is not a hot wallet. This means that it
does <i>not</i> hold your private key. And theres no View Seed button in the
wallet, like we saw in exercise 9. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">However, you can still see the transactions
and addresses, though you cant spend. So, its more secure to have a watch
only wallet set up on your computer than it is to have an actual hot wallet,
which is what your Alice wallet is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">To create the wallet, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Open Sparrow. Close all wallets except the Alice wallet.</span></p>

only wallet in Sparrow. You should be able to see, in the Transaction window of
the Alice Watch Only wallet, the same transactions that you see in the Alice
wallet. </span></p>
<h3>Learn more: Public keys, watch only wallets, and privacy</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">A watch only wallet is created, as you saw above, with the
public key. Sometimes in more technical discussions, its called extended
public key, or master public key, but Ill use the term public key in this
book.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In Bitcoin, your public key is similar to an
account number. From it, you (or anyone) can generate addresses, and use those
addresses to send you bitcoin. And because they see your addresses, they can
track your transactions on those addresses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Your public key is generated <i>from</i> your
private key with some complex math, but can't be reversed to reveal your
private key. And without your private key, your bitcoin cannot be spent. Still,
you dont want to expose your public key, because anyone who knows it can track
all your bitcoin addresses, and all your transactions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">So, for the sake of privacy, make sure that
you keep your public key a secret.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">One common use of watch only wallets is to
generate receive addresses. Well talk about this more in an upcoming exercise.</span></p>

(The labels will be missing on the watch only wallet, though, just like theyre
missing for the transactions.)</span></p>
<h3>Learn more: Why are the labels missing? </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Why do the labels only show up in the Alice
wallet? Its because the label isnt part of the bitcoin blockchain. The label
is stored inside the Sparrow wallet file, and not on the blockchain. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">When youre recovering a wallet from a seed
phrase, or creating a watch only wallet, all the information you see comes from
the bitcoin blockchain, because thats where its fetched from. Recovering a
wallet from the seed phrase, or creating a watch only wallet</span>both of
these will generate a list of addresses. When those addresses are checked in
the bitcoin blockchain, it gives you any transactions (along with the amounts
and dates) associated with the addresses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">What youre explicitly <i>not</i> getting is
information thats stored in the Sparrow wallet file, such as labels from
transactions or addresses. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Heres another thing to note about the
labelthe transaction gets the label from the original address. For instance,
when you set up your initial receive transaction, from the exchange to your Alice
wallet, you entered a label for the receive address. This label shows up as the
label for the transaction as well.</span></p>
<h3>Learn more: checking receive addresses</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The last step in this exercise was to compare
addresses. Whats the point of comparing the receive addresses between the Alice
wallet, and the Alice Watch Only wallet? You did the same thing in Exercise 5:
Recover your Alice wallet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Heres the reason you compare the addresses.
If any of the settings of the wallet are different (such as the script type, or
derivation path), then the addresses will be different. In order to make sure
that its set up correctly, you check to make sure that the first few addresses
are the same between the two wallets. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In this case, its not strictly necessary
because you already see the transactions in the watch only wallet. This means
that Sparrow used the correct addresses, and found the correct transactions.
But its definitely a good idea to remember to check addresses, whenever
creating a watch only wallet.</span></p>

exposed).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In order to do this, we use a watch only
wallet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">In Sparrow, open the Bob wallet, and the Alice Watch Only wallet. Close
all other wallets, especially the Alice wallet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Go to the Alice Watch Only wallet. Click on the blue <b>Receive</b>

Only.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">In Amount, enter the number of sats that youll be sending to Alice Watch
Onlyabout half of your balance. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Click <b>Create Transaction</b> on the bottom right. On the next

<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN">6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>     </span></span><span lang="EN">Now click <b>Sign</b>, in the bottom right corner. Then click <b>Broadcast
Transaction</b>. Remember, if the Broadcast Transaction button is not visible,
you may need to reconnect with the slider at the very bottom right.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">This sends the transaction that you just
created to the bitcoin mempool. Because you have the two wallets that are
involved in this transaction open, youll get two pop-up notices from Sparrow.
One will have a negative amount for the Bob wallet, the other will have a positive
amount for the Alice Watch Only wallet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">From there, the transaction will soon get added
to a block, and be incorporated into the blockchain. Youll receive two more
notices (one for each open wallet) when the first confirmation happens, usually
in around 10 minutes.</span></p>
<h3>Learn more: Receive addresses from watch only wallets</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Getting receive addresses via a watch only
wallet is very common. For instance, say that somebody wants to pay you in
bitcoin. If you have your watch only wallet set up, you can give them a receive
address, using <i>only</i> the watch only wallet. You may want to do this
because as you acquire more bitcoin, youll set up your wallet much more securely
than your current wallets. You may have it hidden away somewhere, or in a safe.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In general, you want to keep your bitcoin
wallets secure, and that means not opening them frequently. A watch only
wallet, set up with the public key of your main wallet, can prevent you from
needing to open your wallet just for a receive address.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Of course, before relying on a watch only
wallet like this, make sure that the watch only wallet is set up correctly.
Its important to check that the receive addresses are identical to the
original wallet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">If youve done all the previous steps, Sparrow

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Heres why this is happening. Sparrow is not
able to provide signing authority for the Alice Watch Only wallet, because it
doesnt have the private key for it, since its a watch only wallet. Often, to
provide a private key to send from a watch only wallet, you would connect a
hardware wallet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">For a watch only wallet, Sparrow only has the public
key, from which it can look up the addresses associated with that key. But it cannot
sign any transactions to send from those addresses.</span></p>
<h3>Try again</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Now, try the exact same process, using the same
steps above, with one changemake sure the Alice wallet is <i>open</i>, instead
of closed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Notice that when youre on the screen that has
the </span>Finalize Transaction for Signing button, theres a Signing
Wallet dropdown, just above the button. Sparrow has determined that the Alice
wallet has signing authority, and makes it the default signing wallet, even if
you created the transaction from the watch only wallet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Now, after you click Sign, Sparrow <i>does</i>
allow you to sign. If you choose to, you can continue and actually click <b>Broadcast

it will be used to do the signing.</span></p>

that theyre in a different format. In the original Bob wallet, they all start
with bc1. Also, the rest of the address is different as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The Transactions screen in the new wallet
should be empty, with a zero balance. Even though you used the same exact seed
phrase, the addresses are different if the script type is different. Sparrow
checks the blockchain only for those addresses that it knows about. And it uses
the script type to generate the addresses, so it gets different addresses when
the script type is different. </span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc185499983">Learn more</a>: Script type problems</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most important thing to remember about script type is
that whenever youre recovering a wallet, or using a watch only wallet, you <i>must</i>
match the script type (and other settings, like the Derivation) with the
original wallet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin script types define address formats and spending
rules. The default now, in 2025, is Native Segwit, but earlier it was
different. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This should happen by default, in most modern bitcoin wallet
software, but its best to check.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">This situationhaving different script types
when youre trying to recover a wallethas caused many people anxiety. Maybe
you <i>know</i> that you wrote down and entered the seed phrase correctly, but
you just dont see any transactions when you know there should be some. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">But it may be that when you created your
wallet, the software you used had one particular default script type. And then
in the software you used to recover it, the default script type is different.
That causes the addresses to be different, which causes the transactions to not
be found. When the transactions cant be found, your wallet shows a balance of
zero.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">You wont have an exercise on this, but the derivation
setting is similar to script type. If you restore your wallet with an incorrect
derivation, you will get different addresses, and will not see your bitcoin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Its important to know that getting the Script
Type or Derivation wrong is not bad in the same way as losing your seed phrase.
If you have completely lost your seed phrase, there is no chance at all of
recovering your bitcoin. But if theres a script type mismatch, you just need
to fix that one thing, and youll be fine. </span></p>

created a completely different private key, with different addresses. When
Sparrow looks up those addresses on the blockchain, theres no transactions
associated with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The <i>password</i> (as opposed to
passphrase), in Sparrow, is just an extra piece of security that you can put on
your wallet file. If you lose the password, but still have the seed phrase, you
can easily restore the wallet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In contrast, the passphrase is a special
concept in bitcoin. When you create a wallet with a certain seed phrase, and no
passphrase, you generate a specific private key. But when you create a wallet
with the exact same seed phrase, and add a passphrase, you get a completely
different private key. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Beginners and experts alike often have
problems with passphrases. It can seem like a good idea to get some extra
security on the seed phrase. </span></p>

up a passphrase and then forgetting itis <i>the most common problem</i> that
causes people to lose their bitcoin in self custody. People think theyll

<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>If you purchased the bitcoin from an exchange, it can look somewhat
complex. Its likely that there will be one input (from your exchange), and
many outputs, as the exchange splits the payments to many different peoples
addresses.<br/>
One of these outputs is the one you received, into your address. Your output
has a downward pointing arrow icon, the others have what looks like a paper

<h3>Learn more: Never reuse bitcoin addresses</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you saw in the exercise above, its simple to track
bitcoin, if you know the bitcoin address. The fact that no history is lost in
the bitcoin blockchain is another reason to be careful about your privacy. One
of the ways to improve your privacy in bitcoin is to never use a bitcoin
address more than once.</p>
<p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Never reuse bitcoin addresses</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If someone happens to know one of your bitcoin addresses,
and if you use that address again and again, they know exactly how much bitcoin
you have in it. They also know when you received it, and how much you received
in each transaction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, most modern bitcoin wallet software makes it
difficult to reuse a bitcoin address. For instance, in Sparrow, when you click
Receive, you are given a new receive address, and not one that youve used
before. </p>
<h3>Learn more: Expanding on the Blockchain </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">In a previous exercise, you learned some of
the essentials about the bitcoin blockchain. Its basically a public ledger,
stored and duplicated on an enormous, decentralized network of computers
running bitcoin software, all around the world. It records every single bitcoin
transaction that has ever taken place, in chronological order. In it you can
see all the addresses in the transactions, and the amount of bitcoin associated
with each address. And also, its completely open to the publicif you had a
spare computer, you could run a bitcoin node in your home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">About every 10 minutes on the blockchain, a
new block is added on top of the last block. This has been happening with
almost 100% reliability ever since bitcoin was first started up in January
2009. When a new block is created and attached to the bitcoin blockchain, its
like a new link on a metal chainthe new block is attached to the previous
block via a mathematical fingerprint.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Theres a popular saying among bitcoiners,
Tick tock, next block</span></p>
<p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Tick tock, next block</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">This saying captures the mindset of
bitcoiners. The price might be up or down, but Bitcoin will keep on going. And
it will gradually but steadily replace other types of money. No government or
corporation in the world can stop bitcoin from being transacted, and new blocks
from being added to the blockchain.</span></p>

<h1><a name="_Toc202777455"><span lang="EN">Exercise 18: Bitcoin feeswhat you
pay, and why</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nows a good time to learn more about bitcoin fees.
Transaction fees, of course, directly affect how much you need to pay to
process your bitcoin transactions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is a good time to remember that were paying fees all
the time, to process our transactions. For instance, when you use a regular
credit card at a grocery store, youre usually paying around 2 to 5% in fees.
We think that its the merchant whos paying the fees, but in the end, it all
comes from the customers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The good thing about bitcoin fees is that unlike credit card
fees, its not a percentage of the transaction amount. Instead, its based on
how much digital space the transaction would take in a block. So, you could
potentially transfer huge amounts of bitcoin for a tiny fee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The metric for the transaction fee in bitcoin is sats/vByte,
or sat/vB. A low transaction fee rate would be 1 or 2 sats/vByte. Occasionally,
transaction fees can go up very high, but transaction fees are low now (early
2025).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The front page of the website <a href="https://mempool.space"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space</span></a> has good information
on what the current fee rates are. Its divided up into No priority, Low
Priority, Medium Priority, and High priority. The High priority ones will
usually make it into the next block. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mempool.space also has great historical information on fees.
To access it, go to <a href="https://mempool.space/"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space/</span></a>
and then click the white Graph icon at the top, then the blue Mining dropdown
on the left, and choose Block Fee Rates. Or you can go directly to <a href="https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates</span></a>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do some exploration on the Block Fee Rates page, using the
time ranges at the top right (24h, 3D, 1W, etc.), and the bar sliders on the
bottom, to learn more about bitcoin fees. Answer the following questions. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In the past 24 hours, at around what time were the highest fees paid?
How about the lowest?</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>For the past month, when were the lowest fees paid? </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>When were some notable spikes in bitcoin transaction fees, looking at
all of the historical data you have available?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes its hard to see the overall patterns because of
seemingly random spikes in the fees. Often theres a spike when theres a lot
of interest in bitcoin and the price is appreciating. Another cause may be NFTs
and Ordinals (see below for more info), which are digital items that can cause
congestion on the bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some of the following exercises, youll experiment with
different fee rates. </p>
<h3>Learn more: Bitcoin transactions that are not on the blockchain</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Its important to know that not all transactions have to be
logged directly on the bitcoin blockchain. There are other options for sending
and receiving bitcoin, on whats called Layer 2. These transactions are not
directly or immediately on the blockchain. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most popular Layer 2 is the Lightning network. Most
smaller bitcoin transactions happen on the Lightning network. Theres more
information about Lightning in the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a> chapter
at the end of this book.</p>
<h3>Learn more: NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Bitcoin transaction fees spike up, its usually from either
increased interest in bitcoin, or increased interest in NFTs, Ordinals, and
Runes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes are digital items that live on the
bitcoin blockchain. Some fans like to buy and trade themthe hope is that like
trading cards, they may appreciate in value. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These items take up much more space on the block than a
regular transaction, so they make regular transactions expensive. Trading in
NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes tends to come in waves. You can see (on
mempool.space) a huge spike in bitcoin transaction fees in late 2023 and early
2024. This was caused by trading in NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes. </p>
<h3>Learn more: Paying the lowest fees possible</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">For practical purposes, heres what you need to remember
about bitcoin transaction fees:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>In the past few years (2024-2025), bitcoin fees have been
generally low. They probably wont cause you much concern.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>In general, for low transaction fees, do them in the morning on
weekends. Theres not as many transactions happening, so competition is lower.
Sunday morning in the Eastern Standard time zone can be particularly cheapyou
can check historical fees and see that fees at this time are usually low.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>If you dont want your transaction to go through immediately, you
dont have to pay the recommended fee amount. In periods of high transaction
fees, Ive input a lower fee, and the transaction has still gone through. It
will just take longer, Ive waited anywhere from an hour to a week. <br/>
<span lang="EN">But remember, if a transaction needs to happen quickly, you need
to pay the fee to get it included in the next block.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span><span lang="EN">If you have a stuck transaction because you set the
transaction fee too low, there are some options. One of them is whats called a
RBF (Replace By Fee), another is CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). We wont get
into the details here, but do a search online for either term, along with the
keyword Sparrow, and youll find some information. <br/>

<h1><a name="_Toc202777456"><span lang="EN">Exercise 19: Install Blue Wallet and
create the Carol wallet</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your next exercise is to install the Blue Wallet app on your
phone, and create a new wallet with it. Blue Wallet is a widely used bitcoin
wallet that has a long track record. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why bother working with another wallet? Wouldnt it be
easier to just stick with Sparrow, since youve learned so much about it? Yes,
it would be easier. But you wouldnt learn as much. And you wouldnt have
practiced your ability to restore a seed phrase and test a wallet in an
entirely different system. And thats a <i>very</i> important skill to have,
and practice regularly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also, learning how a different type of wallet software
operates will solidify your understanding of some of the basic concepts of
bitcoinprivate keys, addresses, and transactions. Comparing two different
products helps illustrate these concepts. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Blue Wallet is mostly a mobile wallet, but also has a
desktop version for MacOS. Well use it on the phone to generate a new wallet, Carol.
Just like Alice and Bob, Carol represents a new user of bitcoin. Then well
send bitcoin to Carol, and do some other exercises.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Go to the website (<a href="https://bluewallet.io/"><span style="color:windowtext">https://bluewallet.io/</span></a>). Towards the bottom
there are links to install it via Google Play or the Apple App Store. Also, you
can install it directly on an Android phone, via the APK. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Choose whichever mobile option you prefer, and complete the
install. The version that I installed was 7.1.6.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, set up the Carol wallet using the following steps:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>On a fresh install of Blue Wallet, youll see an <b>Add now </b>button,
to start a new wallet. Click it.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In the Name field at the top, type <b>Carol</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Theres an option to choose between a regular Bitcoin wallet, and a
Multisig Vaultbasically between a single sig wallet, and a multisig wallet.
Keep the default of Bitcoin, and click <b>Create</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In the next screen Your wallet has been created, youre presented with
the seed phrase (Blue Wallet refers to it as a mnemonic phrase). <b>Write them
down</b> on a sheet of paper, labeled Carol Seed Phrase. Keep this paper safe. <br/>
<b>Warning</b>: Blue Wallet does <i>not</i> ask you to check your seed phrase,
unlike Sparrow. Be sure to double check that you wrote it down correctly,
because its easy to be careless. I just made this mistake myself. One of my
words was two, and for some reason I wrote down too instead of two. I
would have been without a good backup. Luckily, I had a feeling that I was
going too quickly, so I double-checked and figured it out in time.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>To make it easier to read amounts, switch from the default, of using BTC
as the unit, to sats. To do this, click on the Carol wallet to bring it up.
Click on the label that says BTC to the right of the amount field. This will switch
between BTC, sats, and USD (or whatever currency you have set up in the
Settings).</p>
<h3>Learn more: Blue Wallet</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Notice that Blue Wallet has many fewer options than Sparrow.
Theres only one option for the number of words in your seed phrase (12). And
the script type (which Blue Wallet calls Type) is not customizable. You can
view the Type, Addresses, and other settings by clicking the three dots in the
top right corner, when the wallet is open.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But Blue Wallet is very straightforward to use, and probably
has all the functionality you need for a mobile phone wallet. Like Sparrow,
Blue Wallet is also open source, which means that the code is publicly
available for review (<a href="https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet"><span style="color:windowtext">https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet</span></a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heres a security tip to keep in mind: Whenever you install
any bitcoin related software, be very sure that the site youre installing it
from is the real one. For Sparrow, you went to the right site<a href="https://SparrowWallet.com"><span style="color:windowtext">https://SparrowWallet.com</span></a>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If youre downloading an app, make sure its the real thing
as well. Often scammer apps will get onto the Google Play Store, or Apple App
Store. These apps are designed to look just like the real app. Always double-check
with reputable people or established websites to be sure youre installing the
real thing. </p>
<h3>Learn more: what is logged in the bitcoin blockchain?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this exercise you created a new wallet in Blue Wallet.
Consider for a momentis there anything in the bitcoin blockchain, right now,
that registers that this wallet has been created? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No, theres not. This step just creates the wallet in Blue
Wallet. Youve basically just had Blue Wallet create a very large random number
for youyour private key, encoded by your seed phrase. You could do this even
without an internet connection. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But no actual transactions have taken place. And its only
the transactions that are broadcast, and logged in the blockchain. The creation
of a wallet is not logged in the blockchain.</p>
<div style="border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in">
<h1><a name="_Toc202777457"><span lang="EN">Exercise 20: Send bitcoin from Bob in
Sparrow to Carol in Blue Wallet</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this exercise, Bob will send some bitcoin to Carol. To
simulate this, youll transfer from the Bob wallet in Sparrow to the Carol
wallet in Blue Wallet. This will be your first transaction into the Carol
wallet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It will also be your first time transacting with a new
bitcoin wallet application. These transactions between different bitcoin
applications help you learn how to do the essentials using different systems,
and strengthen your understanding of Bitcoin as a whole.</p>
<h3>Preparing the transaction </h3>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>

<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>When getting the address from Blue Wallet to Sparrow, its easiest to
use your computers webcam, to scan the QR code for the receive address. Switch
back to Sparrow. You scan the QR code by <b>clicking the icon of a camera</b>,
to the right of the Pay to text box. Then put your phone screen in front of
the webcam, so the webcam can see your phone and <b>scan the QR</b> code.
Youll have to experiment with moving your phone around in front of the
computer webcam, so it can be read. <br/>
If your computer doesnt have a webcam, you can get the bitcoin address from
the phone to the computer via sharing (in email, or whatever you normally use).
But if possible, use the QR code, its easier and more private. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>

<h3>Learn More: Different derivation paths = different address</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an older version of Blue Wallet, the steps you just went
through would not have worked. You wouldnt have seen any transactions. This
was because if you imported an xpub in Blue Wallet, the wallet would have been
set up with a different script type and derivation path. This means the
transactions would never have shown up, because different addresses would have
been generated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This caused lots of problems and stress for people who set
up a watch only wallet to get receive addresses. They did this to easily
receive bitcoin, while not having their seed phrase in Blue Wallet. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But if they used a receive address that they copied from
Blue Wallet, the transaction would never have shown up in Sparrow because of
the difference in derivation path.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Happily, this problem has now been resolved by Blue Wallet.
But always remember to do some checking when setting up a watch only wallet. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:

<p class="MsoNormal">Now youll take the public key from Sparrow via the
descriptor field, and use it to create a new watch only wallet. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The descriptor in Sparrow is like an expanded version of the
public key, which gives complete details about the setup of the wallet. Not
only does it include the public key (xpub/zpub), it also includes the
derivation path, the script type, etc. It makes interoperability between
different wallet applications much easier.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc202777461"><span lang="EN">Exercise 24: Set up password
protection on Blue Wallet</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Blue Wallet offers a password feature similar to Sparrow.
However, its not exactly the same because in Sparrow, youre putting the
password on one wallet file. In Blue Wallet, though, youre putting the
password on the whole application. Having a password on Blue Wallet gives you
an extra layer of security. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that the password on Blue Wallet is not like a
passphrase. It does not change the private key, and you can still restore the
wallet using just the seed phrase, in case you lose or forget your Blue Wallet
password.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Follow these steps to set a password on Blue Wallet:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Open Blue Wallet and make sure youre in the home screen, where all the available
wallets are shown. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Click the three dots</b> in the top right corner, and choose
Security. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Enable the option<b> </b>for <b>Encrypted and Password Protected</b>. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Blue Wallet will give you a confirmation screen (about only protecting
the data on your phone, and not actually the seed phrase). Click <b>I
Understand</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Next, enter a secure password, then re-enter it, and click <b>OK</b>.
Your Blue Wallet data on your phone is now encrypted and password protected. Be
sure to keep the password safe. (But remember, you can still restore the wallet
with the backed up seed phrase).</p>
<h3>Learn more</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">What are you actually protecting in this step? Youre
protecting the data linked with Blue Wallet on your phone. So if your phone
were lost or stolen, anyone who has the phone wouldnt be able to access your
Blue Wallet data (depending on how secure your password is).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But it <i>only</i> provides protection for the Blue Wallet
data on your phone. What it is <i>not</i> doing is providing any sort of
protection for your seed phrase, outside of the phone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For instance, assume you back up your seed phrase in a
secure location, as you should. However, someone with bad intentions still finds
that seed phrase. In that situation, the fact that you have a password on Blue
Wallet doesnt help you. Anyone with the backup seed phrase could just restore
it to another wallet software, and steal your funds.</p>

means that you typed in the seed phrase incorrectly. Check the words very
carefully, make sure the spelling is exact, and that theres a space between
each word.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Checking the recovered wallet</b>: To double-check that
the recovered wallet was set up correctly, do two things:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Review transactions</b>: You should be able to see the same transactions
in the Bob Recovery wallet in Blue Wallet as you do in the original Bob wallet
in Sparrow. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Review Addresses</b>: Assuming you see the transactions, everything
should be good. But in general (and especially if the original wallet has no
transactions) you want to review addresses between the original and a recovered
wallet. <br/>
In the Bob wallet in Sparrow, click on the blue Addresses button to see the
addresses. In the Bob Recovery wallet in Blue Wallet, click on the three dots
at the top right. At the very bottom of the dropdown, theres a <b>Show
Addresses</b> option. Compare a few of them with the Sparrow addresses. They
should be the same. (Blue Wallet makes it difficult to review the addresses
that are already used, so just look at the unused ones.)</p>
<h3>Learn more: the private key is portable between wallet applications. </h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you know by now, you see identical transactions in Blue
Wallet and Sparrow because you used either the public key (for a watch only
wallet) or the seed phrase (to recover a wallet). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the recovered wallet, you entered the seed phrase that
was generated for the first Bob wallet. That seed phrase translates to the same
private key, and that private key is linked to the same addresses (assuming the
script type, etc., is set up correctly). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Blue Wallet looks up the addresses in the blockchain,
it finds the same transactions as Sparrow did, looking up those same addresses
in the blockchain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is that you dont
need any <i>specific</i> software. As long as you hold your own private key
(which is the whole point of self custody), nobody can prevent you from
switching to a different bitcoin software wallet. For instance, if you didnt
like Sparrow, you might decide to work with Blue Wallet. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Compare this to traditional banking. Switching banks
requires a lengthy processtransferring funds, closing your old account,
submitting ID documents to open a new one, and waiting for approvals. You need
permission from financial institutions and government agencies at every step.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or, consider people living in countries where its difficult
or impossible to get a bank account. They are often forced to use actual paper
currency, which is always losing value, sometimes rapidly. So, theyre completely
unable to save money for their future.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin can be a lifeline in these situations, if you know
how to use it. Nobody can prevent you from saving, sending, or receiving
bitcoin.</p>

<h3>Learn more: recovery after a potential seed phrase theft</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">What would you need to do in a real emergency recovery? For
instance, in a situation where your laptop has been stolen, and you had Sparrow
set up on that laptop, with a hot software wallet on it?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the thief understood bitcoin, and knew you had Sparrow
installed with a software wallet, you might be out of luck. The thief would probably
have instantly sent all the bitcoin from your wallet to a different wallet, one
that he controls.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In case the thief didnt know these details, you may have
more time. However, you still need to move your bitcoin. You need to send the
entire amount from your old wallet, with the old seed phrase, to a new wallet
with a new seed phrase. Moving all the funds from one bitcoin wallet to another
is called sweeping.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that if you do this, you will lose all the labels for
your transactions and addresses, because theyre saved in the Sparrow wallet
file, not on the blockchain. This can be a serious issue, because knowing where
your sats came from (through the labels) can be important for privacy. If youd

<h1><a name="_Toc202777465"><span lang="EN">Exercise 28: Clearing practice
wallets and creating a long-term wallet</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">If youve followed all the steps in the exercises, all
wallets should be cleared out and empty, <i>except</i> for the Alice wallet.
Thats the only one that should contain bitcoin. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If this isnt the case, go ahead now and do that. You dont
want to have bitcoin sitting around in multiple wallets, unless you have a specific
purpose in mind. If you always want a place to experiment and practice with
bitcoin transactions, you could leave a small amount of bitcoin in the Alice
wallet. Otherwise, you can transfer it to a new wallet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Youll probably want to create a real wallet now, a
long-term one, and one that may potentially hold a substantial amount of
bitcoin. Go ahead and do that, using what youve learned. Below are some best
practices to consider.</p>
<h3>Keeping your seed phrase safe</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The guidelines that you follow when working with this new
wallet will be differentyoull need to think more about privacy and security.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">The wallet youll be creatingunlike the ones
you just used in the exercisesis <i>not</i> a short-term wallet for learning

<div style="border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in">
<h1><a name="_Toc202777466"><span lang="EN">Final notes and next steps</span></a></h1>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Completing the exercises in this book is a major milestone. You
have a rock-solid understanding of the mechanics of bitcoin private keys and
transactions. Youve practiced with them in many different ways. This
familiarity is important. It lessens the fear that most people have, of making
some kind of mistake and losing bitcoin. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The confidence that develops through following the exercises
and gradually understanding the conceptsthat confidence is critical. The most
important thing it allows you to do is <i>take action, </i>and avoid the
analysis paralysis caused by fear. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, congratulations! And lets talk about some of the next topics
youll be interested in learning more about.</p>
<h3>Security and privacy</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the beginning, when you were working with small,
temporary wallets, you didnt need to worry very much about security. The
amounts were small, and the wallet was temporary. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now you need to think about security differently. The
realization should have become crystal clearyour seed phrase, and the private
key it represents, is the key to your bitcoin. So if anyone with bad intentions
were to find it, they could very easily steal your bitcoin. They would do this
in the exact same way that you moved bitcoin around, in the exercises.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also, the Alice and Bob wallet have been opened in multiple
different toolsSparrow, Blue Wallet, Blockstream. As practice exercises, its
good to work with multiple wallets, to develop skills and a better
understanding of transactions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But for a wallet that contains larger amounts of bitcoin,
and that will be a long-term holding wallet, you want to expose it as little as
possible. Its like telling a secret to three trustworthy friends. Sure,
theyre trustworthy, but it would be far more private and secure to not tell
the secret to anyone. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Privacy and security go together like hand and glove. If
youre private about your bitcoin holdings, then your security is far, far
better. Most of the physical attacks related to bitcoin have been on people who
have somehow been in the public eye because of bitcoin. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Talk about bitcoin, if you want. But never tell people how
much you own, and dont post anything online or on social media about how much
you own. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Privacy is very important. For instance, in Sweden there are
laws that put all tax records in the public domain, including names and
addresses. Criminals have searched those records, and then linked them to
social media mentions of bitcoin. Those searches provided the criminals with
good targets, and there have been multiple attacks on bitcoiners in Sweden. (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swedish-bitcoiners-targeted-by-armed-criminals"><span style="color:windowtext">https://cointelegraph.com/news/swedish-bitcoiners-targeted-by-armed-criminals</span></a>,
retrieved 2/6/2025)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember: good security habits are built over time. Dont
rush into complex setups before mastering the basics. Your security approach
should evolve over time, just like your knowledge and assets in bitcoin.</p>
<h3>Threat model</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, when you self custody your own bitcoin, you are
immune to <i>the</i> most common threat to your bitcoin, which is when the
exchange that you hold your bitcoin on is hacked, or if the exchange itself has
stolen the funds. Another major threat if you dont self custody is that the
government can force the exchange to hand over all the bitcoin that it
holdsbitcoin that you thought was yours.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But assuming your bitcoin is in self custody, you want to
consider the concept of threat model. For instancein your particular
situation, what is the most likely threat to your bitcoin stash? Then, based on
that, you make decisions about how to best protect it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lets consider some of the most commonly recognized threats:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Losing your seed phrase</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Fire, flood, or other disaster destroying your seed phrase backup</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Robbery and physical coercion, to reveal your seed phrase</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Malware on your computer that captures your keystrokes, and
watches for anything like a seed phrase</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>A scammer convinced you to reveal your seed phrase</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>User error, making a mistake because your security setup is too
complex. For instance, adding a passphrase to the seed phrase, and forgetting
the passphrase</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>You die, and your heirs dont know how to access your bitcoin</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are situations you need to consider, and guard
against. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or lets say youre a refugee, escaping a war. You have
managed to scrape together some bitcoin, and need to cross multiple borders
with it. Whats your main concern, in this situation? Its to make sure that
you dont have anything on you to indicate you might own bitcoin. No hardware
wallets, no software wallets on your phone, no suspicious looking lists of 12
words as you pass through various immigration checkpoints. In this case, youd
want to carefully memorize your seed phrase, and then set up your wallet again
when youre settled in a safe place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you live in an area where forest fires are common? In
that situation, you definitely need to have a backup of your seed phrase in a
different location, or maybe a multisig setup.</p>
<h3>If you have a lot of bitcoin to secure</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You might be in a situation where need to secure a
substantial amount of bitcoin. In that case, theres a whole separate set of
strategies to consider. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The maker of Sparrow Wallet, Craig Raw, has some suggestions
about what kind of security and privacy considerations you need to take, as you
put more of your assets into bitcoin. See what he has to say here: <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html"><span style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html</span></a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heres some additional strategies to consider:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Multiple backups</b>: If you have just one backup of your
seed phrase, youre vulnerable to losing access to your bitcoin. Especially if
you have larger amounts to worry about, you will want to consider having
another copy of your seed phrase, perhaps given in encrypted format to a close
friend or family. The danger, of course, is that theres another copy of your
seed phrase out there.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Multisig wallets</b>: These are usually done as a 2 of 3
setup, in which there are 3 seed phrases, and 2 of them are needed to sign a
transaction and spend bitcoin. The seed phrases are usually stored in different
physical locations, so it would be much more difficult for thieves to get
access to 2 of them. The tradeoff is that theyre more complex to set up and
maintain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bitcoin Timelocks</b>: Timelocks are a bitcoin security
feature that restrict spending until a certain condition is met, such as when a
specific time has passed. This is a mostly unexplored area, but I predict that
itll start becoming much more popular as more bitcoin wallet software starts
supporting it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Have a cold storage vault</b>: If you have substantial
assets in bitcoin, consider having separate wallets for different purposes. The
cold storage vault gets the most security, of course.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Cold storage vault: You have the majority of your assets here.
Its rarely accessed except to receive bitcoin, and its accessed via a watch
only wallet except in case of emergency. This would be like a safe, with gold
bars in it, kept very secure.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Spending account: This is where most transactions occur. This is
more like a checking account, or a debit card, or cash in your wallet. Security
isnt as much of a concern. You may also choose to do smaller transactions in
the Lightning network (see the section on Lightning in the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>
chapter).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Run your own bitcoin node</b>: If you have substantial
assets in bitcoin to protect, you should consider connecting to a private
bitcoin node that you control. When connecting to public bitcoin nodes, which
is the default in Sparrow, theres the potential that youre exposing private
informationnot the seed phrase, but information about what IP address is
linked to a particular bitcoin address. And often an IP address can be linked
to a street address.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another option if you cant run a bitcoin node is to run a
Tor proxy in Sparrow, which also gives better privacy. You can find more info
on this topic online. </p>
<h3>Hardware wallets</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What is a hardware wallet?</b> A hardware wallet is a
small, specialized device that has one purpose onlyto store the private keys
needed to access your bitcoin. When you want to send bitcoin, you need to get
the hardware wallet, and usually unlock it with a PIN. Then your hardware
wallet transmits the digital signature to the computer where the bitcoin
transaction is being managed. The transaction can be set up with Sparrow, but
usually the hardware wallet will have its own software. The signature is
usually sent via a USB cable, or sometimes with QR codes. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN">Do you need to buy a hardware wallet
immediately?</span></b><span lang="EN"> Hardware wallet manufacturers would like
you to buy one, of course. And these manufacturers are very influential, and
advertise heavily in bitcoin podcasts and videos.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">But my answer would be no, you dont need to.
Not until your stash of bitcoin is more substantial, or unless you have special
requirements. Its okay to begin with a hot wallet on Sparrow or Blue Wallet,
assuming the laptop or phone is properly secured.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">Think of it this wayyou need to consider the
security and privacy of your bitcoin in a step-by-step approach. You wouldnt
purchase an expensive safe if you only have a small piece of silver to secure,
right? You would purchase that safe only if you have a gold bar that you want
to securesomething much more valuable. The same principle applies with holding
a smaller amount of bitcoin. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Theres some negatives to hardware wallets as well.</b> Hardware
wallets can offer some protection for bitcoin storage when everything works
well, but they arent the perfect solution. Yes, they can protect private keys
from malware. At the same time, they also introduce their own risks, like
closed-source software, and mandatory firmware updates. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And hardware wallets remain completely out of reach for many
people in poorer countries, because of cost, availability, and import barriers.
Its almost impossible to find any hardware wallet for less than about $75. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But maybe the most important factor is that once youve
purchased a hardware wallet, youre advertising to the world that you probably
own bitcoin. And there have been <i>major</i> data leaks. In 2020, the largest
hardware wallet company, Ledger, was hacked and the entire customer database,
including name, address, and order details, was published. These types of
issues happen over and over, and make people very nervous. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The standard advice is to not have hardware wallets shipped
to your home address, only to a post office box. But that option introduces
extra expense, complications, and delay. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations:</b> So, I dont necessarily recommend
hardware wallets to beginners, when they first start their bitcoin journey. Until
you accumulate an amount of bitcoin that would cause serious pain if you lost
it, consider this setup:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>A hot wallet in Sparrow, with a password on the wallet file. Or a
hot wallet on a phone, also with a password.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Make sure your computer or phone is well secured.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Back up your seed phrase well, potentially in multiple locations </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then as you learn more about bitcoin and security and
accumulate more, you may decide that you should get a hardware wallet, and
store your seed phrase on the hardware wallet. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Make sure the one you buy is bitcoin only, and doesnt use
proprietary software (in other words, it should be open source). Below are some
of the most well-known options.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The SeedSigner is a hardware wallet that you can put
together yourself, with a Raspberry PI and a few other components. You can also
purchase a fully assembled one on the SeedSigner website. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some people have also gone the DIY approach, by using
TailsOS on a USB stick, or similar options. Heres a post that has more
information on that method: <a href="https://stacker.news/items/569901"><span style="color:windowtext">https://stacker.news/items/569901</span></a>. Make
sure you do some research before you choose this option.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I suggest that you continue to use Sparrow to manage and coordinate
transactionsits more secure than the software provided by the hardware wallet
vendor. Also, you now have a very good understanding of Sparrow, after going
through these exercises.</p>
<h3>Keep on learning</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">As youve learned throughout this book, the basics of
Bitcoin are straightforward. There are many details that can make the process
of dealing with wallets, and sending and receiving bitcoin challenging. But
think of this: you now know more about the practical use of bitcoin than the
vast majority of the worlds population. The skills youve developed, in
working with this revolutionary monetary technology, are ones that most people
havent begun to grasp. These skills allow you to take control of your financial
future as a sovereign individual.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Theres a popular phrase in Bitcoin, about <i>going down
the rabbit hole</i>. Most bitcoiners have, at one point or another, become
obsessive about learning as much as possible about Bitcoin (the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a> section in this book is a good place to start).
They spend hundreds of hours, reading books and articles, listening to podcasts
and videos, and talking to other bitcoiners both in person and online. And one
topic leads to anotherits really an endlessly fascinating journey. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is just the beginning of your journey. As you grow more
comfortable with Bitcoins concepts and tools, youll discover new ideas and
tools. Start small, experiment often, and build on each success. Many people
began learning about Bitcoin with only NGU in mind (a bitcoin term <i>Number
Go Up</i>, in other words, just a raw desire to make money). Then later, they
find themselves going deeper and deeper into Bitcoins fascinating economic and
technical layers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Take your time, stay curious, and keep learningthe rabbit
hole goes as deep as you dare to explore. Ill leave you with a favorite saying
of bitcoiners everywhere:</p>
<p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Fix the money, fix the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is Bitcoins promise: an alternative to broken money
and theft via inflation. By reclaiming control of your wealth through
self-custody, youre not just protecting your futureyoure opting out of a
broken system. Bitcoin restores money as a tool of freedom, not force. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The revolution starts in your wallet.</p>

<h3>Books, articles, and videos</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Bullish Case for Bitcoin by Vijay Boyapati</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many people have been introduced to the why of bitcoin
through one article published on Medium: <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">The
Bullish Case for Bitcoin</a>. Its an inspiring introduction to Bitcoin, including
a review of money throughout history. Boyapati writes a primer on the value of
Bitcoin, and why its superior to government currency, and even gold. Hes also
expanded the article into an entire book, which is also a good read.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This classic book is the one that everyone even remotely
interested in Bitcoin should read. Ammous goes into great depth on what makes a
good money, and why. He writes about the best monies throughout history, and how
when one type of money replaces another, those who hold on to the old form of
money are impoverished.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bitcoin University YouTube channel </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the YouTube channels that I recommend for learning
about Bitcoin is Bitcoin University (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University"><span style="color:windowtext">https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University</span></a>).
The creator, Matthew Kratter has solid information on self custody as well as
many other aspects of Bitcoin. <br/>
A reminderwith YouTube channels, the comments section will often have
scammers, so be cautious.</p>
<h3>The Lightning Network</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoins blockchain is secure and reliable, but it can be inconvenient
and expensive for small transactions. This is especially a problem when the
transaction fees are high. To solve this, developers have created whats called
Layer-2 solutions. These work on top of the Bitcoin network, to make
transactions faster and cheaper. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most popular layer 2 is the Lightning Network. The
Lightning Network lets users open payment channels, to send bitcoin instantly
with very low fees. Instead of recording every transaction on the blockchain,
lightning handles them off-chain, and only settles the final result on the bitcoin
blockchain. This makes it perfect for small transactions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If youre using lightning regularly, be aware that it
evolves quickly, and wallet apps sometimes disappear. In the United States,
some of the most popular lightning wallets have been removed from app stores
because of financial regulations. So, its important to stay informed, and
avoid keeping large amounts in your lightning wallet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lightning wallet apps fall into two categoriescustodial and
non-custodial.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Custodial Lightning</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The custodial ones take custody of your bitcoin on the app,
and dont allow you to manage it directly. But they also dont require you to
know the details of payment channels and nodes, which can be very challenging.
These types of app charge a small fee for sending transactions. Also, since
its not self custody, its best to avoid storing larger amounts on them. </p>

already have a lightning wallet built into it. However, its KYC, and thus tied

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Non-custodial Lightning </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The non-custodial apps do not take charge of your bitcoin,
instead you work with your own bitcoin on the app. They require you to
understand and manage your own lightning channels and nodes. You still pay a
fee, but its lower and you have much more control over fees. Lightning is a
fascinating area to learn about, but self custody with lightning is challenging
for beginners. So, Id recommend lots of research before setting up a lightning
channel. Some of the more popular non-custodial apps are </p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you need more support for any of the tools youve worked
with, a good place to go is the sites recommended on the official website.
Often these are hosted on Telegram. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For instance, if you need help with Sparrow, go to the
official Sparrow website (<a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/"><span style="color:black">https://sparrowwallet.com/</span></a>), and look for the
Telegram link, right above the Download button. The hardware wallet SeedSigner also
has a link to their Telegram group on the FAQ page. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One thing to note about any public bitcoin group, especially
in Telegram, is that they are <i>very</i> heavily targeted by scammers. If you
ever post on one of these, youll immediately get multiple people sending you
private messages. Theyre all from scammers, so never respond to any private
messages. Everything thats legitimate is in public chat on these groups. And
of course, never give anyone your seed phrase.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Never search for bitcoin related telegram groups by
searching directly in Telegram. There are many groups out there that have
official sounding names, but are actually run by scammers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For instance, theres a Telegram group called Sparrow
Technical Support, run by scammers. If you post there, the administrators will
try to get you to reveal your seed phrase. When looking for a support group on
Telegram, only go to the Telegram group link from the official website.</p>

Customer) and P2P (Peer To Peer). </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>KYC</b> is what most people use, in countries where
exchanges are available. It means using a centralized exchange, which follows
government Know Your Customer laws. On a KYC exchange, you need to open an
account, linked to your government ID, to purchase bitcoin. You will need to go
through an identity verification process. This usually includes submitting
photos of government-issued ID, as well as facial scans.</p><b>KYC</b><p class="MsoNormal"><b>P2P </b>means youre not going through a regular
exchange. Instead, youre buying from a peersomeone who owns bitcoin and wants
to sell it. </p><b>P2P </b><p class="MsoNormal">If youre lucky enough to have a friend or family member
whos willing to sell you a small amount of bitcoin, then the transaction can
be very simple. You hand the friend or family member some cash, and give them a
bitcoin address from your wallet. Then they send you the bitcoin (minus the
transaction fee).</p><p class="MsoNormal">But often, P2P trades will be done online, via one of the secure,
private services mentioned below. </p><p class="MsoNormal">One of the main benefits of buying P2P is increased privacy.
If youre buying peer to peer, the only other person that knows about the
purchase is the seller. However, if youre buying from a KYC exchange, your
personal information is available to both the exchange, and the government. And
considering how often companies have been hacked and their customer database
stolenits not just the government who could get your data. Criminal gangs
could get it as well.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The problem for people just starting to buy bitcoin is that
for these P2P services, you need to already own at least a small amount of
bitcoin. This is because usually a bitcoin bond or escrow needs to be set up. </p><h3>KYC Exchanges</h3><p class="MsoNormal">If youve decided that for now, youll use a KYC exchange,
you have many options. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Its important to purchase from a bitcoin-only exchange. An
exchange that is bitcoin-only will have fewer points of failure. And more
importantly, they wont try to sell you other, inferior cryptocurrencies, that
they make more commission on. Companies that sell anything other than bitcoin
(exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, Binance) are <i>not </i>recommended.</p><i>not </i><p class="MsoNormal">Theres a saying among bitcoiners that expresses a core
beliefthat Bitcoin stands alone, and is fundamentally superior to other
cryptocurrencies. </p><p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Bitcoin, not crypto.</span></p><span lang="EN">Bitcoin, not crypto.</span><p class="MsoNormal">Heres some KYC exchanges that are Bitcoin-only. This is not
an exhaustive list, and this information can change quickly, so do your own
research. Also, the exchange should make it very clear that they will actually
allow you to withdraw your bitcoin, to your own wallet. </p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid" style="border-collapse:collapse;border:none">

instead of copying and pasting the address.</p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>

block of transactions, which means linking the new block to the previous one in

bitcoin, if you know the bitcoin address. The fact that no history is lost in
the bitcoin blockchain is another reason to be careful about your privacy. One
of the ways to improve your privacy in bitcoin is to never use a bitcoin
address more than once.</p><p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Never reuse bitcoin addresses</span></p><span lang="EN">Never reuse bitcoin addresses</span><p class="MsoNormal">If someone happens to know one of your bitcoin addresses,
and if you use that address again and again, they know exactly how much bitcoin
you have in it. They also know when you received it, and how much you received
in each transaction.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, most modern bitcoin wallet software makes it
difficult to reuse a bitcoin address. For instance, in Sparrow, when you click

pay, and why</span><p class="MsoNormal">Nows a good time to learn more about bitcoin fees.
Transaction fees, of course, directly affect how much you need to pay to
process your bitcoin transactions. </p><p class="MsoNormal">This is a good time to remember that were paying fees all
the time, to process our transactions. For instance, when you use a regular
credit card at a grocery store, youre usually paying around 2 to 5% in fees.
We think that its the merchant whos paying the fees, but in the end, it all
comes from the customers. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The good thing about bitcoin fees is that unlike credit card
fees, its not a percentage of the transaction amount. Instead, its based on
how much digital space the transaction would take in a block. So, you could
potentially transfer huge amounts of bitcoin for a tiny fee.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The metric for the transaction fee in bitcoin is sats/vByte,
or sat/vB. A low transaction fee rate would be 1 or 2 sats/vByte. Occasionally,
transaction fees can go up very high, but transaction fees are low now (early
2025).</p><p class="MsoNormal">The front page of the website <a href="https://mempool.space"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space</span></a> has good information
on what the current fee rates are. Its divided up into No priority, Low
Priority, Medium Priority, and High priority. The High priority ones will
usually make it into the next block. </p><a href="https://mempool.space"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space</span><p class="MsoNormal">Mempool.space also has great historical information on fees.
To access it, go to <a href="https://mempool.space/"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space/</span></a>
and then click the white Graph icon at the top, then the blue Mining dropdown
on the left, and choose Block Fee Rates. Or you can go directly to <a href="https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates"><span style="color:windowtext">https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates</span></a>.

time ranges at the top right (24h, 3D, 1W, etc.), and the bar sliders on the
bottom, to learn more about bitcoin fees. Answer the following questions. </p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>

</span>When were some notable spikes in bitcoin transaction fees, looking at
all of the historical data you have available?</p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes its hard to see the overall patterns because of
seemingly random spikes in the fees. Often theres a spike when theres a lot
of interest in bitcoin and the price is appreciating. Another cause may be NFTs
and Ordinals (see below for more info), which are digital items that can cause
congestion on the bitcoin blockchain.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In some of the following exercises, youll experiment with
different fee rates. </p><h3>Learn more: Bitcoin transactions that are not on the blockchain</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Its important to know that not all transactions have to be
logged directly on the bitcoin blockchain. There are other options for sending
and receiving bitcoin, on whats called Layer 2. These transactions are not
directly or immediately on the blockchain. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The most popular Layer 2 is the Lightning network. Most
smaller bitcoin transactions happen on the Lightning network. Theres more
information about Lightning in the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a> chapter
at the end of this book.</p><a href="#Resources">Resources</a><h3>Learn more: NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes</h3><p class="MsoNormal">When Bitcoin transaction fees spike up, its usually from either
increased interest in bitcoin, or increased interest in NFTs, Ordinals, and
Runes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes are digital items that live on the
bitcoin blockchain. Some fans like to buy and trade themthe hope is that like
trading cards, they may appreciate in value. </p><p class="MsoNormal">These items take up much more space on the block than a
regular transaction, so they make regular transactions expensive. Trading in
NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes tends to come in waves. You can see (on
mempool.space) a huge spike in bitcoin transaction fees in late 2023 and early
2024. This was caused by trading in NFTs, Ordinals, and Runes. </p><h3>Learn more: Paying the lowest fees possible</h3><p class="MsoNormal">For practical purposes, heres what you need to remember
about bitcoin transaction fees:</p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:

create the Carol wallet</span></a><span lang="EN">Exercise 19: Install Blue Wallet and
create the Carol wallet</span><p class="MsoNormal">Your next exercise is to install the Blue Wallet app on your
phone, and create a new wallet with it. Blue Wallet is a widely used bitcoin
wallet that has a long track record. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Why bother working with another wallet? Wouldnt it be
easier to just stick with Sparrow, since youve learned so much about it? Yes,
it would be easier. But you wouldnt learn as much. And you wouldnt have
practiced your ability to restore a seed phrase and test a wallet in an
entirely different system. And thats a <i>very</i> important skill to have,
and practice regularly.</p><i>very</i><p class="MsoNormal">Also, learning how a different type of wallet software
operates will solidify your understanding of some of the basic concepts of
bitcoinprivate keys, addresses, and transactions. Comparing two different
products helps illustrate these concepts. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Blue Wallet is mostly a mobile wallet, but also has a
desktop version for MacOS. Well use it on the phone to generate a new wallet, Carol.
Just like Alice and Bob, Carol represents a new user of bitcoin. Then well
send bitcoin to Carol, and do some other exercises.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Go to the website (<a href="https://bluewallet.io/"><span style="color:windowtext">https://bluewallet.io/</span></a>). Towards the bottom
there are links to install it via Google Play or the Apple App Store. Also, you
can install it directly on an Android phone, via the APK. </p><a href="https://bluewallet.io/"><span style="color:windowtext">https://bluewallet.io/</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://bluewallet.io/</span><p class="MsoNormal">Choose whichever mobile option you prefer, and complete the
install. The version that I installed was 7.1.6.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Now, set up the Carol wallet using the following steps:</p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>On a fresh install of Blue Wallet, youll see an <b>Add now </b>button,
to start a new wallet. Click it.</p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Add now </b><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In the Name field at the top, type <b>Carol</b>.</p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Carol</b><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>Theres an option to choose between a regular Bitcoin wallet, and a
Multisig Vaultbasically between a single sig wallet, and a multisig wallet.
Keep the default of Bitcoin, and click <b>Create</b>.</p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Create</b><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>In the next screen Your wallet has been created, youre presented with
the seed phrase (Blue Wallet refers to it as a mnemonic phrase). <b>Write them
down</b> on a sheet of paper, labeled Carol Seed Phrase. Keep this paper safe. <br/>
<b>Warning</b>: Blue Wallet does <i>not</i> ask you to check your seed phrase,
unlike Sparrow. Be sure to double check that you wrote it down correctly,
because its easy to be careless. I just made this mistake myself. One of my
words was two, and for some reason I wrote down too instead of two. I
would have been without a good backup. Luckily, I had a feeling that I was
going too quickly, so I double-checked and figured it out in time.</p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><b>Write them
down</b><br/><b>Warning</b><i>not</i><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span>To make it easier to read amounts, switch from the default, of using BTC
as the unit, to sats. To do this, click on the Carol wallet to bring it up.
Click on the label that says BTC to the right of the amount field. This will switch
between BTC, sats, and USD (or whatever currency you have set up in the
Settings).</p><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>    
</span><h3>Learn more: Blue Wallet</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Notice that Blue Wallet has many fewer options than Sparrow.
Theres only one option for the number of words in your seed phrase (12). And
the script type (which Blue Wallet calls Type) is not customizable. You can
view the Type, Addresses, and other settings by clicking the three dots in the
top right corner, when the wallet is open.</p><p class="MsoNormal">But Blue Wallet is very straightforward to use, and probably
has all the functionality you need for a mobile phone wallet. Like Sparrow,
Blue Wallet is also open source, which means that the code is publicly
available for review (<a href="https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet"><span style="color:windowtext">https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet</span></a>).</p><a href="https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet"><span style="color:windowtext">https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet</span><p class="MsoNormal">Heres a security tip to keep in mind: Whenever you install
any bitcoin related software, be very sure that the site youre installing it
from is the real one. For Sparrow, you went to the right site<a href="https://SparrowWallet.com"><span style="color:windowtext">https://SparrowWallet.com</span></a>.
</p><a href="https://SparrowWallet.com"><span style="color:windowtext">https://SparrowWallet.com</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://SparrowWallet.com</span><p class="MsoNormal">If youre downloading an app, make sure its the real thing
as well. Often scammer apps will get onto the Google Play Store, or Apple App
Store. These apps are designed to look just like the real app. Always double-check
with reputable people or established websites to be sure youre installing the
real thing. </p><h3>Learn more: what is logged in the bitcoin blockchain?</h3><p class="MsoNormal">In this exercise you created a new wallet in Blue Wallet.
Consider for a momentis there anything in the bitcoin blockchain, right now,
that registers that this wallet has been created? </p><p class="MsoNormal">No, theres not. This step just creates the wallet in Blue
Wallet. Youve basically just had Blue Wallet create a very large random number
for youyour private key, encoded by your seed phrase. You could do this even
without an internet connection. </p><p class="MsoNormal">But no actual transactions have taken place. And its only
the transactions that are broadcast, and logged in the blockchain. The creation
of a wallet is not logged in the blockchain.</p><div style="border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in">

</span>When getting the address from Blue Wallet to Sparrow, its easiest to
use your computers webcam, to scan the QR code for the receive address. Switch
back to Sparrow. You scan the QR code by <b>clicking the icon of a camera</b>,
to the right of the Pay to text box. Then put your phone screen in front of
the webcam, so the webcam can see your phone and <b>scan the QR</b> code.
Youll have to experiment with moving your phone around in front of the
computer webcam, so it can be read. <br/>
If your computer doesnt have a webcam, you can get the bitcoin address from
the phone to the computer via sharing (in email, or whatever you normally use).

</span><h3>Learn More: Different derivation paths = different address</h3><p class="MsoNormal">In an older version of Blue Wallet, the steps you just went
through would not have worked. You wouldnt have seen any transactions. This
was because if you imported an xpub in Blue Wallet, the wallet would have been
set up with a different script type and derivation path. This means the
transactions would never have shown up, because different addresses would have
been generated.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This caused lots of problems and stress for people who set
up a watch only wallet to get receive addresses. They did this to easily
receive bitcoin, while not having their seed phrase in Blue Wallet. </p><p class="MsoNormal">But if they used a receive address that they copied from
Blue Wallet, the transaction would never have shown up in Sparrow because of
the difference in derivation path.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Happily, this problem has now been resolved by Blue Wallet.

However, its not exactly the same because in Sparrow, youre putting the

Wallet and Sparrow because you used either the public key (for a watch only
wallet) or the seed phrase (to recover a wallet). </p><p class="MsoNormal">For the recovered wallet, you entered the seed phrase that
was generated for the first Bob wallet. That seed phrase translates to the same
private key, and that private key is linked to the same addresses (assuming the
script type, etc., is set up correctly). </p><p class="MsoNormal">When Blue Wallet looks up the addresses in the blockchain,
it finds the same transactions as Sparrow did, looking up those same addresses
in the blockchain.</p><p class="MsoNormal">One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is that you dont
need any <i>specific</i> software. As long as you hold your own private key
(which is the whole point of self custody), nobody can prevent you from
switching to a different bitcoin software wallet. For instance, if you didnt
like Sparrow, you might decide to work with Blue Wallet. </p><i>specific</i><p class="MsoNormal">Compare this to traditional banking. Switching banks
requires a lengthy processtransferring funds, closing your old account,
submitting ID documents to open a new one, and waiting for approvals. You need
permission from financial institutions and government agencies at every step.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Or, consider people living in countries where its difficult
or impossible to get a bank account. They are often forced to use actual paper
currency, which is always losing value, sometimes rapidly. So, theyre completely
unable to save money for their future.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin can be a lifeline in these situations, if you know
how to use it. Nobody can prevent you from saving, sending, or receiving

instance, in a situation where your laptop has been stolen, and you had Sparrow
set up on that laptop, with a hot software wallet on it?</p><p class="MsoNormal">If the thief understood bitcoin, and knew you had Sparrow
installed with a software wallet, you might be out of luck. The thief would probably
have instantly sent all the bitcoin from your wallet to a different wallet, one
that he controls.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In case the thief didnt know these details, you may have
more time. However, you still need to move your bitcoin. You need to send the
entire amount from your old wallet, with the old seed phrase, to a new wallet
with a new seed phrase. Moving all the funds from one bitcoin wallet to another
is called sweeping.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Note that if you do this, you will lose all the labels for
your transactions and addresses, because theyre saved in the Sparrow wallet
file, not on the blockchain. This can be a serious issue, because knowing where
your sats came from (through the labels) can be important for privacy. If youd
like to learn more, read up on the topic of coin control in bitcoin.</p><div style="border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in">

You
have a rock-solid understanding of the mechanics of bitcoin private keys and
transactions. Youve practiced with them in many different ways. This
familiarity is important. It lessens the fear that most people have, of making
some kind of mistake and losing bitcoin. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The confidence that develops through following the exercises
and gradually understanding the conceptsthat confidence is critical. The most
important thing it allows you to do is <i>take action, </i>and avoid the
analysis paralysis caused by fear. </p><i>take action, </i><p class="MsoNormal">So, congratulations! And lets talk about some of the next topics
youll be interested in learning more about.</p><h3>Security and privacy</h3><p class="MsoNormal">At the beginning, when you were working with small,
temporary wallets, you didnt need to worry very much about security. The
amounts were small, and the wallet was temporary. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Now you need to think about security differently. The
realization should have become crystal clearyour seed phrase, and the private
key it represents, is the key to your bitcoin. So if anyone with bad intentions
were to find it, they could very easily steal your bitcoin. They would do this
in the exact same way that you moved bitcoin around, in the exercises.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Also, the Alice and Bob wallet have been opened in multiple
different toolsSparrow, Blue Wallet, Blockstream. As practice exercises, its
good to work with multiple wallets, to develop skills and a better
understanding of transactions. </p><p class="MsoNormal">But for a wallet that contains larger amounts of bitcoin,
and that will be a long-term holding wallet, you want to expose it as little as
possible. Its like telling a secret to three trustworthy friends. Sure,
theyre trustworthy, but it would be far more private and secure to not tell
the secret to anyone. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Privacy and security go together like hand and glove. If
youre private about your bitcoin holdings, then your security is far, far
better. Most of the physical attacks related to bitcoin have been on people who
have somehow been in the public eye because of bitcoin. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Talk about bitcoin, if you want. But never tell people how
much you own, and dont post anything online or on social media about how much
you own. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Privacy is very important. For instance, in Sweden there are
laws that put all tax records in the public domain, including names and
addresses. Criminals have searched those records, and then linked them to
social media mentions of bitcoin. Those searches provided the criminals with
good targets, and there have been multiple attacks on bitcoiners in Sweden. (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swedish-bitcoiners-targeted-by-armed-criminals"><span style="color:windowtext">https://cointelegraph.com/news/swedish-bitcoiners-targeted-by-armed-criminals</span></a>,

Dont
rush into complex setups before mastering the basics. Your security approach
should evolve over time, just like your knowledge and assets in bitcoin.</p><h3>Threat model</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Of course, when you self custody your own bitcoin, you are
immune to <i>the</i> most common threat to your bitcoin, which is when the
exchange that you hold your bitcoin on is hacked, or if the exchange itself has
stolen the funds. Another major threat if you dont self custody is that the
government can force the exchange to hand over all the bitcoin that it
holdsbitcoin that you thought was yours.</p><i>the</i><p class="MsoNormal">But assuming your bitcoin is in self custody, you want to
consider the concept of threat model. For instancein your particular
situation, what is the most likely threat to your bitcoin stash? Then, based on
that, you make decisions about how to best protect it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lets consider some of the most commonly recognized threats:</p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:

</span><p class="MsoNormal">These are situations you need to consider, and guard
against. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Or lets say youre a refugee, escaping a war. You have
managed to scrape together some bitcoin, and need to cross multiple borders
with it. Whats your main concern, in this situation? Its to make sure that
you dont have anything on you to indicate you might own bitcoin. No hardware
wallets, no software wallets on your phone, no suspicious looking lists of 12
words as you pass through various immigration checkpoints. In this case, youd
want to carefully memorize your seed phrase, and then set up your wallet again
when youre settled in a safe place.</p><p class="MsoNormal">If you live in an area where forest fires are common? In
that situation, you definitely need to have a backup of your seed phrase in a
different location, or maybe a multisig setup.</p><h3>If you have a lot of bitcoin to secure</h3><p class="MsoNormal">You might be in a situation where need to secure a
substantial amount of bitcoin. In that case, theres a whole separate set of
strategies to consider. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The maker of Sparrow Wallet, Craig Raw, has some suggestions
about what kind of security and privacy considerations you need to take, as you
put more of your assets into bitcoin. See what he has to say here: <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html"><span style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html</span></a>.</p><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html"><span style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html</span><p class="MsoNormal">Heres some additional strategies to consider:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Multiple backups</b>: If you have just one backup of your
seed phrase, youre vulnerable to losing access to your bitcoin. Especially if
you have larger amounts to worry about, you will want to consider having
another copy of your seed phrase, perhaps given in encrypted format to a close
friend or family. The danger, of course, is that theres another copy of your
seed phrase out there.</p><b>Multiple backups</b><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Multisig wallets</b>: These are usually done as a 2 of 3
setup, in which there are 3 seed phrases, and 2 of them are needed to sign a
transaction and spend bitcoin. The seed phrases are usually stored in different
physical locations, so it would be much more difficult for thieves to get
access to 2 of them. The tradeoff is that theyre more complex to set up and
maintain.</p><b>Multisig wallets</b><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bitcoin Timelocks</b>: Timelocks are a bitcoin security
feature that restrict spending until a certain condition is met, such as when a
specific time has passed. This is a mostly unexplored area, but I predict that
itll start becoming much more popular as more bitcoin wallet software starts
supporting it.</p><b>Bitcoin Timelocks</b><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Have a cold storage vault</b>: If you have substantial
assets in bitcoin, consider having separate wallets for different purposes. The
cold storage vault gets the most security, of course.</p><b>Have a cold storage vault</b><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Cold storage vault: You have the majority of your assets here.
Its rarely accessed except to receive bitcoin, and its accessed via a watch
only wallet except in case of emergency. This would be like a safe, with gold
bars in it, kept very secure.</p><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>

</span><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:
Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span></span>Spending account: This is where most transactions occur. This is
more like a checking account, or a debit card, or cash in your wallet. Security
isnt as much of a concern. You may also choose to do smaller transactions in
the Lightning network (see the section on Lightning in the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>
chapter).</p><span style="font-family:

</span></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>      
</span><a href="#Resources">Resources</a><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Run your own bitcoin node</b>: If you have substantial
assets in bitcoin to protect, you should consider connecting to a private
bitcoin node that you control. When connecting to public bitcoin nodes, which
is the default in Sparrow, theres the potential that youre exposing private
informationnot the seed phrase, but information about what IP address is
linked to a particular bitcoin address. And often an IP address can be linked
to a street address.</p><b>Run your own bitcoin node</b><p class="MsoNormal">Another option if you cant run a bitcoin node is to run a
Tor proxy in Sparrow, which also gives better privacy. You can find more info
on this topic online. </p><h3>Hardware wallets</h3><p class="MsoNormal"><b>What is a hardware wallet?</b> A hardware wallet is a
small, specialized device that has one purpose onlyto store the private keys
needed to access your bitcoin. When you want to send bitcoin, you need to get
the hardware wallet, and usually unlock it with a PIN. Then your hardware
wallet transmits the digital signature to the computer where the bitcoin
transaction is being managed. The transaction can be set up with Sparrow, but
usually the hardware wallet will have its own software. The signature is
usually sent via a USB cable, or sometimes with QR codes. </p><b>What is a hardware wallet?</b><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN">Do you need to buy a hardware wallet
immediately?</span></b><span lang="EN"> Hardware wallet manufacturers would like
you to buy one, of course. And these manufacturers are very influential, and
advertise heavily in bitcoin podcasts and videos.</span></p><b><span lang="EN">Do you need to buy a hardware wallet

immediately?</span><span lang="EN"> Hardware wallet manufacturers would like
you to buy one, of course. And these manufacturers are very influential, and
advertise heavily in bitcoin podcasts and videos.</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN">But my answer would be no, you dont need to.
Not until your stash of bitcoin is more substantial, or unless you have special
requirements. Its okay to begin with a hot wallet on Sparrow or Blue Wallet,
assuming the laptop or phone is properly secured.</span></p><span lang="EN">But my answer would be no, you dont need to.

security and privacy of your bitcoin in a step-by-step approach. You wouldnt

to securesomething much more valuable. The same principle applies with holding
a smaller amount of bitcoin. </span></p><span lang="EN">Think of it this wayyou need to consider the

wallets can offer some protection for bitcoin storage when everything works
well, but they arent the perfect solution. Yes, they can protect private keys
from malware. At the same time, they also introduce their own risks, like
closed-source software, and mandatory firmware updates. </p><b>Theres some negatives to hardware wallets as well.</b><p class="MsoNormal">And hardware wallets remain completely out of reach for many
people in poorer countries, because of cost, availability, and import barriers.
Its almost impossible to find any hardware wallet for less than about $75. </p><p class="MsoNormal">But maybe the most important factor is that once youve
purchased a hardware wallet, youre advertising to the world that you probably
own bitcoin. And there have been <i>major</i> data leaks. In 2020, the largest
hardware wallet company, Ledger, was hacked and the entire customer database,
including name, address, and order details, was published. These types of
issues happen over and over, and make people very nervous. </p><i>major</i><p class="MsoNormal">The standard advice is to not have hardware wallets shipped
to your home address, only to a post office box. But that option introduces
extra expense, complications, and delay. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations:</b> So, I dont necessarily recommend
hardware wallets to beginners, when they first start their bitcoin journey. Until
you accumulate an amount of bitcoin that would cause serious pain if you lost
it, consider this setup:</p><b>Recommendations:</b><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:

together yourself, with a Raspberry PI and a few other components. You can also
purchase a fully assembled one on the SeedSigner website. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Some people have also gone the DIY approach, by using
TailsOS on a USB stick, or similar options. Heres a post that has more
information on that method: <a href="https://stacker.news/items/569901"><span style="color:windowtext">https://stacker.news/items/569901</span></a>. Make
sure you do some research before you choose this option.</p><a href="https://stacker.news/items/569901"><span style="color:windowtext">https://stacker.news/items/569901</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://stacker.news/items/569901</span><p class="MsoNormal">I suggest that you continue to use Sparrow to manage and coordinate
transactionsits more secure than the software provided by the hardware wallet
vendor. Also, you now have a very good understanding of Sparrow, after going
through these exercises.</p><h3>Keep on learning</h3><p class="MsoNormal">As youve learned throughout this book, the basics of
Bitcoin are straightforward. There are many details that can make the process
of dealing with wallets, and sending and receiving bitcoin challenging. But
think of this: you now know more about the practical use of bitcoin than the
vast majority of the worlds population. The skills youve developed, in
working with this revolutionary monetary technology, are ones that most people
havent begun to grasp. These skills allow you to take control of your financial
future as a sovereign individual.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Theres a popular phrase in Bitcoin, about <i>going down
the rabbit hole</i>. Most bitcoiners have, at one point or another, become
obsessive about learning as much as possible about Bitcoin (the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a> section in this book is a good place to start).
They spend hundreds of hours, reading books and articles, listening to podcasts
and videos, and talking to other bitcoiners both in person and online. And one
topic leads to anotherits really an endlessly fascinating journey. </p><i>going down
the rabbit hole</i><a href="#Resources">Resources</a><p class="MsoNormal">This is just the beginning of your journey. As you grow more
comfortable with Bitcoins concepts and tools, youll discover new ideas and
tools. Start small, experiment often, and build on each success. Many people
began learning about Bitcoin with only NGU in mind (a bitcoin term <i>Number
Go Up</i>, in other words, just a raw desire to make money). Then later, they
find themselves going deeper and deeper into Bitcoins fascinating economic and
technical layers. </p><i>Number
Go Up</i><p class="MsoNormal">Take your time, stay curious, and keep learningthe rabbit
hole goes as deep as you dare to explore. Ill leave you with a favorite saying
of bitcoiners everywhere:</p><p class="MsoQuote"><span lang="EN">Fix the money, fix the world.</span></p><span lang="EN">Fix the money, fix the world.</span><p class="MsoNormal">This is Bitcoins promise: an alternative to broken money
and theft via inflation. By reclaiming control of your wealth through
self-custody, youre not just protecting your futureyoure opting out of a
broken system. Bitcoin restores money as a tool of freedom, not force. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The revolution starts in your wallet.</p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><br clear="all" style="page-break-before:always"/>

through one article published on Medium: <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">The
Bullish Case for Bitcoin</a>. Its an inspiring introduction to Bitcoin, including
a review of money throughout history. Boyapati writes a primer on the value of
Bitcoin, and why its superior to government currency, and even gold. Hes also
expanded the article into an entire book, which is also a good read.</p><a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">The

interested in Bitcoin should read. Ammous goes into great depth on what makes a
good money, and why. He writes about the best monies throughout history, and how
when one type of money replaces another, those who hold on to the old form of
money are impoverished.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bitcoin University YouTube channel </b></p><b>Bitcoin University YouTube channel </b><p class="MsoNormal">One of the YouTube channels that I recommend for learning
about Bitcoin is Bitcoin University (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University"><span style="color:windowtext">https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University</span></a>).
The creator, Matthew Kratter has solid information on self custody as well as
many other aspects of Bitcoin. <br/>

scammers, so be cautious.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University"><span style="color:windowtext">https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University</span></a><span style="color:windowtext">https://www.youtube.com/@Bitcoin_University</span><br/><h3>The Lightning Network</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoins blockchain is secure and reliable, but it can be inconvenient
and expensive for small transactions. This is especially a problem when the
transaction fees are high. To solve this, developers have created whats called
Layer-2 solutions. These work on top of the Bitcoin network, to make
transactions faster and cheaper. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The most popular layer 2 is the Lightning Network. The
Lightning Network lets users open payment channels, to send bitcoin instantly
with very low fees. Instead of recording every transaction on the blockchain,
lightning handles them off-chain, and only settles the final result on the bitcoin
blockchain. This makes it perfect for small transactions. </p><p class="MsoNormal">If youre using lightning regularly, be aware that it
evolves quickly, and wallet apps sometimes disappear. In the United States,
some of the most popular lightning wallets have been removed from app stores
because of financial regulations. So, its important to stay informed, and
avoid keeping large amounts in your lightning wallet.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lightning wallet apps fall into two categoriescustodial and
non-custodial.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Custodial Lightning</b></p><b>Custodial Lightning</b><p class="MsoNormal">The custodial ones take custody of your bitcoin on the app,
and dont allow you to manage it directly. But they also dont require you to
know the details of payment channels and nodes, which can be very challenging.
These types of app charge a small fee for sending transactions. Also, since
its not self custody, its best to avoid storing larger amounts on them. </p><p class="MsoNormal">Some of the more popular ones are:</p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:

instead you work with your own bitcoin on the app. They require you to
understand and manage your own lightning channels and nodes. You still pay a
fee, but its lower and you have much more control over fees. Lightning is a
fascinating area to learn about, but self custody with lightning is challenging
for beginners. So, Id recommend lots of research before setting up a lightning
channel. Some of the more popular non-custodial apps are </p><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:

with, a good place to go is the sites recommended on the official website.
Often these are hosted on Telegram. </p><p class="MsoNormal">For instance, if you need help with Sparrow, go to the
official Sparrow website (<a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/"><span style="color:black">https://sparrowwallet.com/</span></a>), and look for the
Telegram link, right above the Download button. The hardware wallet SeedSigner also
has a link to their Telegram group on the FAQ page. </p><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/"><span style="color:black">https://sparrowwallet.com/</span></a><span style="color:black">https://sparrowwallet.com/</span><p class="MsoNormal">One thing to note about any public bitcoin group, especially
in Telegram, is that they are <i>very</i> heavily targeted by scammers. If you
ever post on one of these, youll immediately get multiple people sending you
private messages. Theyre all from scammers, so never respond to any private
messages. Everything thats legitimate is in public chat on these groups. And
of course, never give anyone your seed phrase.</p><i>very</i><p class="MsoNormal">Never search for bitcoin related telegram groups by
searching directly in Telegram. There are many groups out there that have
official sounding names, but are actually run by scammers. </p><p class="MsoNormal">For instance, theres a Telegram group called Sparrow
Technical Support, run by scammers. If you post there, the administrators will
try to get you to reveal your seed phrase. When looking for a support group on
Telegram, only go to the Telegram group link from the official website.</p></body></html>
