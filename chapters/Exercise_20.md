# Exercise 20: Send bitcoin from Bob in Sparrow to Carol in Blue Wallet

In this exercise, Bob will send some bitcoin to Carol. To simulate this, you’ll transfer from the Bob wallet in Sparrow to the Carol wallet in Blue Wallet. This will be your first transaction into the Carol wallet.

It will also be your first time transacting with a new bitcoin wallet application. These transactions between different bitcoin applications help you learn how to do the essentials using different systems, and strengthen your understanding of Bitcoin as a whole.

### Preparing the transaction

1.     In Sparrow, open the Bob wallet, and click on the **Send** button. Close all other wallets.

2.     Switch to the Blue Wallet app on your phone. Click on the **Carol** wallet. It will have zero transactions. Click the **Receive** button at the bottom. You’ll see a QR code, and the matching bitcoin address below that.

3.     When getting the address from Blue Wallet to Sparrow, it’s easiest to use your computer’s webcam, to scan the QR code for the receive address. Switch back to Sparrow. You scan the QR code by **clicking the icon of a camera**, to the right of the “Pay to” text box. Then put your phone screen in front of the webcam, so the webcam can see your phone and **scan the QR** code. You’ll have to experiment with moving your phone around in front of the computer webcam, so it can be read.  
If your computer doesn’t have a webcam, you can get the bitcoin address from the phone to the computer via sharing (in email, or whatever you normally use). But if possible, use the QR code, it’s easier and more private.

4.     For the **Amount** to send from Bob to Carol, choose about half of the amount of bitcoin that you have in Bob. And instead of sending a rounded amount—for instance, 50,000 sats—remember to send something like 50,924.

5.     In Sparrow, label the transaction **Send to Carol on Blue Wallet**.

6.     Continue in Sparrow to follow all the steps you normally do when sending bitcoin. Click **Create Transaction**, then click **Finalize Transaction for Signing**, then **Sign.**

7.     Before you click Broadcast Transaction, you can review everything about the transaction in the screen above. This can be a good practice in general, to make sure you have the fee and the receive address correct.  
Once you’ve checked, click **Broadcast Transaction**.

### Review the transaction in Blue Wallet

As the transaction gets processed, you can check it in Blue Wallet.

·       Just after the send from Sparrow, you may get a “pending” notification in Blue Wallet.

·       Open the Carol wallet. A transaction should show up in Blue Wallet, once it’s confirmed.

·       If the transaction doesn’t show up, especially after Sparrow shows that it’s been confirmed, you may need to close and reopen Blue Wallet.

·       Click on the new transaction in Blue Wallet. On that screen, you can click on the Details button at the top right. That will give you extra info about the transaction, like the input address, output addresses, etc. It should match exactly what you see in the transaction details, in Sparrow.
